Mette is tech-savvy and grew up with smartphones and app stores. She comes from the world of mobile gaming into real-money betting, representing an early-20s demographic that multi-tasks across streaming, social media, and games. She wasn't a traditional sports bettor, but the "snackable" nature of betting apps – quick bets, short videos, game-like features – pulled her in.
