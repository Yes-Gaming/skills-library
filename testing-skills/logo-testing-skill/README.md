# Logo Testing Skill

**Systematic methodology for testing logos, brand marks, and visual identity assets with synthetic gambling personas using multimodal AI analysis.**

## Overview

This skill provides a structured framework for evaluating logo designs through visual analysis with synthetic personas. Unlike text-based testing, logo testing leverages Claude's vision capabilities to analyze actual image files and gather rich qualitative insights about brand perception, visual appeal, and design effectiveness.

## Key Differences from Text Testing

| Aspect | Text Testing (Taglines/CTAs) | Logo Testing |
|--------|------------------------------|--------------|
| **Input** | Text strings | **Image files** |
| **Analysis** | Language processing | **Visual perception** |
| **Response** | Rational evaluation | **Emotional + gut reaction** |
| **Key Metric** | Preference/Action intent | **First impression + Trust + Memory** |
| **Context** | Where message appears | **Size, placement, competitive** |
| **Speed** | Can be deliberate | **3-5 second first impression** |

## When to Use This Skill

Use logo testing when:
- Evaluating multiple logo design concepts
- Making rebrand vs. iteration decisions
- Testing logo variations (colors, layouts)
- Assessing app icon effectiveness
- Understanding brand perception through visuals
- Comparing competitive differentiation
- Testing logo scalability (favicon to billboard)
- Validating visual identity before launch

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Your Logo Assets

**Required:**
- High-resolution PNG files (1024x1024 or larger)
- Transparent backgrounds
- Full color versions

**Recommended:**
- App icon size mockups (120px display)
- Favicon size (32x32)
- Website header mockups
- Competitive context (your logo + competitors)
- Color variations if testing

### 2. Define Test Parameters

**What are you testing?**
- List 2-5 logo options/variations
- Specify what's different between them

**In what contexts?**
- App store icon
- Website header
- Favicon
- Social media profile
- Merchandise/print
- Competitive landscape

**With which personas?**
- Choose from 5 available personas
- Trust Seeker (40+) often sees logos very differently than Casual Entertainer (22-28)

### 3. Run the Test

Follow systematic 10-round protocol with:
- Visual presentation (actual images)
- Context setup
- 6 core questions per round
- Immediate reaction capture
- Verbatim response recording

### 4. Analyze Results

Examine the **Preference-Trust-Memory Triangle:**
- **Preference (Q1):** First impression appeal
- **Trust (Q4):** Professional, trustworthy perception
- **Memory (Q5):** Recognition and recall

**Ideal logo:** All three metrics align (similar scores)
**Red flag:** High preference, low trust (looks cool but not credible)

## Core Question Framework

**Q1: First Impression (Forced Choice)**
"Which logo makes the strongest positive first impression?"
→ Immediate visual appeal (ask within 3-5 seconds)

**Q2: Visual Elements (Open-ended)**
"What do you notice first? Describe what you see."
→ Attention hierarchy, focal points

**Q3: Brand Perception (Open-ended)**
"What does this logo tell you about the brand?"
→ Brand associations and positioning

**Q4: Trust & Quality (Forced Choice)** ⭐ CRITICAL
"Which logo suggests the most trustworthy, professional gambling platform?"
→ Credibility assessment (most important for gambling)

**Q5: Recognition (Forced Choice)**
"Which logo would you most easily recognize again?"
→ Memorability and brand recall

**Q6: Context Fit (Open-ended)**
"Imagine this as an app icon. Does it work? Why or why not?"
→ Practical usability (varies by context)

## Testing Contexts

### 1. App Store Icon ⭐ CRITICAL
- **Size:** 1024x1024 displayed at 60-120px
- **Viewing:** Scrolling app store grid
- **Must Work:** Recognizable when tiny, stands out
- **Test:** Q1, Q4, Q5, Q6

### 2. Website Header
- **Size:** 200-400px width typically
- **Viewing:** Desktop/mobile website
- **Must Work:** Professional, fits design, readable
- **Test:** Q1, Q3, Q4, Q6

### 3. Favicon
- **Size:** 16x16 or 32x32 pixels
- **Viewing:** Browser tab among many tabs
- **Must Work:** Distinctive at microscopic size
- **Test:** Q5, Q8 (clarity at scale)

### 4. Social Media Profile
- **Size:** Circular crop, 200-400px
- **Viewing:** Feed, profile
- **Must Work:** Circular frame, readable in feed
- **Test:** Q1, Q5, Q7

### 5. Competitive Landscape
- **Size:** Side-by-side with 3-5 competitors
- **Viewing:** Comparison shopping
- **Must Work:** Stand out, be memorable
- **Test:** Q7, Q11

## Key Metrics

### The Preference-Trust-Memory Triangle

**High Alignment (Ideal):**
All three scores within 10-15% of each other
→ Logo works on all levels

**Preference > Trust:**
Looks cool but not credible
→ Risk: Clicks but doesn't convert

**Trust > Preference:**
Boring but trustworthy
→ Opportunity: Add visual appeal

**Memory Outlier:**
Remembered differently than preferred
→ Strong distinctive element (good or bad)

### Visual Element Analysis

Track what personas notice first:
- **Colors:** Emotional responses, distinctiveness
- **Shapes:** Recognition, memorability
- **Symbols:** Interpretation, meaning
- **Typography:** Readability, personality

### Brand Perception Themes

Cluster descriptors from Q3:
- **Positive:** Modern, trustworthy, premium, fun, professional
- **Negative:** Cheap, boring, confusing, outdated, sketchy
- **Target alignment:** Who logo seems designed for

### Context Versatility Score

- **Universal:** Works in all contexts (rare, valuable)
- **Specialized:** Excels in 1-2 specific contexts
- **Context-Dependent:** Performance varies wildly (risky)

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Provide actual image files (required)
- Test at multiple sizes (favicon to billboard)
- Test in realistic contexts (app icon, website, etc.)
- Capture immediate 3-5 second reactions
- Ask about specific visual elements
- Test across different age personas
- Check for negative associations
- Compare to competitors
- Test color psychology
- Record emotional responses

### ❌ Don't:
- Describe logos in text (must show visuals)
- Skip small size testing (app icons critical)
- Ignore trust metrics (Q4 most important)
- Test too many options (max 4-5)
- Skip negative reaction questions
- Ignore cultural context
- Assume intent = perception
- Test without competitive context
- Forget accessibility
- Skip context variation

## Example Test Results

### Logo Redesign Test
**Tested:** Current logo vs. 2 redesign concepts, 3 personas, 10 rounds each

**Results:**
- **Redesign A:** High preference (70%), Low trust (25%) ⚠️
- **Current Logo:** Medium preference (30%), High trust (85%) ✅
- **Redesign B:** Low preference (20%), Medium trust (45%) ❌

**Decision:** Keep current logo, incorporate some modern elements from Redesign A

**Why:**
- Trust is critical for gambling (can't sacrifice)
- Redesign A too trendy, perceived as less established
- Older personas (Trust Seeker) strongly preferred current
- App icon test: Current logo more recognizable at small size

- **README.md** - This quick start guide

## Critical for Gambling Platforms

**Trust (Q4) is the most important metric** because:
- Users deposit real money
- Regulatory scrutiny is high
- Credibility drives conversion
- Scam perception kills business
- Older demographics (40+) prioritize trust over "cool"

**Test thoroughly with Trust Seeker persona (40+)** - they often see logos very differently than younger personas.

## Example Usage

```
I want to test our logo redesign. I have 3 options:

[Upload 3 PNG files: current-logo.png, redesign-a.png, redesign-b.png]

Test with all 5 personas, 10 rounds each.

Contexts to test:
- App store icon (mobile)
- Website header
- Competitive landscape (show alongside Bet365, DraftKings, FanDuel)

Use the logo testing skill.
```

## Next Steps

1. Prepare logo image files (PNG, high-res)
2. Decide which contexts to test
3. Choose relevant personas
4. Run systematic test (10 rounds per persona)
5. Analyze preference-trust-memory triangle
6. Review visual element insights
7. Check brand perception alignment
8. Select winning logo
9. Validate with real user A/B test
