# UX Testing Skill

Systematic methodology for testing UX design variations with synthetic gambling personas, focusing on color systems, psychological impact, and behavioral influence.

## Quick Start

```
Load this skill when you need to:
- Test color system variations for betting interfaces
- Evaluate psychological impact of design choices
- Assess visual fatigue and session comfort
- Understand perceived user control vs. app control
- Determine age-appropriateness of design systems
- Measure energy vs. pressure in interface design
- Validate responsible gambling alignment of UX
```

## What Makes This Different

Unlike logo or tagline testing, UX testing focuses on:

- **Psychological Impact**: How design affects user emotional state and behavior
- **Sustained Exposure**: Designs meant to be used for 20-30+ minutes
- **Behavioral Influence**: How design encourages or discourages betting patterns
- **Control Perception**: Whether users feel empowered or manipulated
- **Visual Fatigue**: Eye strain and comfort over extended sessions
- **Energy vs. Pressure**: Energizing (good) vs. pressuring (harmful) distinction

## Core Question Set

### Individual Variant Testing (Q1-Q12)

1. **Overall Feeling** - What emotional response does this color system create?
2. **Visual Attribution** - Which screen elements drive that feeling?
3. **Energy vs. Pressure** - Does it energize or pressure you?
4. **Control Perception** - Who's in control: you or the app?
5. **Restraint Level** - How restrained/unrestrained (1-10)?
6. **Restraint Attribution** - What creates that restraint level?
7. **Visual Fatigue** - How tiring after 20-30 minutes (1-10)?
8. **Age Targeting** - What age range is this designed for?
9. **Behavioral Influence** - What betting behavior does this encourage?
10. **Return Likelihood** - How well does this match an app you'd return to (1-10)?
11. **Entertainment vs. Tool** - Entertainment or serious tool?
12. **Confidence Perception** - Confident/established or experimental/in-your-face?

### Comparative Testing (Q13-Q14)

13. **Most Appropriate** - Which feels most appropriate for a modern betting app?
14. **Least Appropriate** - Which feels least appropriate, and why?

## Key Metrics

### Critical Measurements

- **Return Likelihood (Q10)**: Best predictor of long-term success (target: 7+/10)
- **Visual Fatigue (Q7)**: Session comfort and retention (target: <4/10)
- **User Control (Q4)**: Ethical imperative (target: >75% user control)
- **Energy vs. Pressure (Q3)**: Engagement quality (target: >70% energizing)
- **Restraint Level (Q5)**: Appropriateness for gambling (target: 4-6/10)

### Analysis Frameworks

1. **Control-Energy Matrix**: Maps variations on control and energy axes
2. **Fatigue-Return Correlation**: Low fatigue should predict high return
3. **Entertainment-Trust Balance**: Optimal positioning between fun and serious

## Testing Contexts

Test UX variations in multiple app states:

1. **Homepage / Browse State**: Exploration, welcoming, browsing comfort
2. **Active Betting / Decision State**: Clarity, control, reduced anxiety
3. **Live Betting / High Energy**: Speed, urgency, clarity under pressure
4. **Results / Post-Bet State**: Emotional management, re-engagement
5. **Account / Management State**: Trust, professionalism, serious tool feel
6. **Extended Session (20-30 min)**: Sustained comfort, fatigue testing

## Required Assets

Provide screenshots or mockups:

- Homepage screenshot (mobile/desktop)
- Betting slip / action screen
- Live betting view (if applicable)
- Results/outcome screen
- Account/settings screen
- Color system documentation (hex codes, primary/secondary/accent)

## Typical Test Configuration

- **Personas**: 5 personas (Casual Entertainer, Casino Explorer, Sports Enthusiast, Trust Seeker, Cross-Entertainment Engager)
- **Rounds per persona**: 10
- **Contexts**: 3-5 app states
- **Variations**: 2-4 UX color systems
- **Total test rounds**: 50+ per variation

## Ethical Design Considerations

### Red Flags to Watch For

- **Low User Control (<50%)**: Design may feel manipulative
- **High Pressure (>50%)**: Creates stress rather than enjoyment
- **Encourages Fast/Risky Betting**: Responsible gambling concern
- **High Fatigue (>7/10)**: Limits healthy session length
- **Removes User Agency**: Ethical boundary violation

### Responsible Gambling Alignment

The best UX for gambling should:
- ✅ Maximize user control perception (>75%)
- ✅ Energize without pressuring (>70% energizing, <30% pressuring)
- ✅ Maintain low fatigue for comfortable sessions (<4/10)
- ✅ Encourage thoughtful, measured betting behavior
- ✅ Build trust through confident, established design

## Common Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Color System Selection
**Goal**: Choose from 3-4 color system options
**Focus**: All 12 questions + comparative
**Output**: Clear winner with psychological profile

### Scenario 2: Energy Optimization
**Goal**: Find energy sweet spot between boring and pressuring
**Focus**: Q3, Q4, Q7, Q9
**Output**: Optimal energy level specification

### Scenario 3: Age-Appropriate Design
**Goal**: Ensure design appeals to target demographics
**Focus**: Q8, Q10, Q12
**Output**: Age alignment analysis and refinements

### Scenario 4: Responsible Gambling Validation
**Goal**: Verify ethical design principles
**Focus**: Q4 (control), Q9 (behavior), Q3 (pressure)
**Output**: Ethical certification or required changes

### Scenario 5: Context-Specific Optimization
**Goal**: Determine if UX needs state-specific variations
**Focus**: Context performance across all questions
**Output**: Universal system or context-specific recommendations

## Expected Outputs

### Quantitative Results

- Energy vs. pressure percentages
- Control perception distribution
- Restraint level averages (1-10)
- Visual fatigue scores (1-10)

## Integration with Personas

Use with these persona skills:

- **Casual Entertainer (22-28)**: Energy and entertainment preferences, higher fatigue tolerance
- **Casino Explorer (20-30)**: Visual quality emphasis, discovery-focused
- **Sports Enthusiast (25-35)**: Clarity under pressure, speed requirements
- **Trust Seeker (40+)**: Control, trust signals, lower fatigue tolerance, highest LTV
- **Cross-Entertainment Engager (18-40)**: Modern expectations, integrated experience

**Trust Seeker is CRITICAL**: Highest LTV demographic, most control-sensitive, most fatigue-sensitive

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- Provide actual screenshots, not descriptions
- Test in multiple app states/contexts
- Test sustained exposure (20-30 minutes)
- Capture emotional responses verbatim
- Assess control perception (ethical imperative)
- Test across age ranges (psychology varies)
- Check for behavioral nudges (responsible gambling)
- Measure return likelihood (best retention predictor)
- Compare energy vs. pressure (energizing good, pressuring harmful)
- Validate with real users after synthetic testing

### ❌ Avoid This

- Describing UX in text instead of showing visuals
- Skipping fatigue testing (critical for retention)
- Ignoring control perception (ethical red flag)
- Testing in only one context (UX is context-dependent)
- Skipping behavioral influence analysis (RG concern)
- Assuming designer intent = user perception
- Ignoring older demographics (often highest LTV)
- Sacrificing control for energy (ethical boundary)
- Forgetting accessibility (contrast, color blindness)
- Skipping comparative testing (need clear winner)

## Validation Requirements

Before production rollout:

1. **Real User Testing**: Validate with n=100+ actual users
2. **A/B Testing**: Production test with small percentage
3. **Accessibility Audit**: WCAG AA, color blindness, fatigue tools
4. **Extended Session Testing**: Real 20-30 minute sessions with eye tracking
5. **Behavioral Impact Measurement**: Betting speed, size, frequency tracking
6. **Demographic Validation**: Actual age group testing
7. **Responsible Gambling Metrics**: Monitor RG tool usage patterns

## Success Criteria

A winning UX variation should achieve:

- **Return Likelihood**: >7/10 average
- **Visual Fatigue**: <4/10 average
- **User Control**: >75% perceive user in control
- **Energy (not Pressure)**: >70% energizing, <30% pressuring
- **Restraint Level**: 4-6/10 (balanced for gambling context)
- **Trust Seeker Approval**: >7/10 return likelihood from 40+ demographic
- **Age Alignment**: Perception matches target demographic
- **Behavioral Alignment**: Encourages thoughtful, measured betting
- **Comparative Winner**: Most "most appropriate" votes, fewest "least appropriate"
