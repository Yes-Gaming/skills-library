# CTA Testing Skill

**Systematic methodology for testing call-to-action (CTA) copy and button text with synthetic gambling personas.**

## Overview

This skill provides a structured framework for testing CTA effectiveness across different contexts, personas, and use cases. Unlike tagline testing, CTA testing is highly context-dependent and focuses on conversion optimization rather than brand preference.

## Key Differences from Tagline Testing

| Aspect | Tagline Testing | CTA Testing |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Focus** | Brand preference, appeal | Conversion, action intent |
| **Context** | Optional, general | Critical, must be specific |
| **Key Metric** | Preference votes | Intent-to-value ratio |
| **Friction** | Less critical | Make-or-break factor |
| **Versatility** | Taglines work broadly | CTAs are context-specific |
| **Testing** | Can test standalone | Must test in context |

## When to Use This Skill

Use CTA testing when optimizing:
- Landing page hero buttons
- Registration flow actions
- Deposit/payment prompts
- Email call-to-actions
- In-app action buttons
- Promotional campaign CTAs
- Re-engagement messaging

## Quick Start

### 1. Define Your Test

**What are you testing?**
- List 2-5 CTA options

**In what context?**
- Landing page hero
- Mid-registration
- First deposit
- Promotional email
- In-app prompt

**With which personas?**
- Select from available persona library

### 2. Run the Test

Follow the systematic 10-round protocol with:
- Context setup (critical!)
- Randomized presentation
- 4 core questions per round
- Verbatim response recording

### 3. Analyze Results

Key metrics to examine:
- **Action Intent (Q1):** Who would click?
- **Motivation (Q2):** Why would they click?
- **Friction (Q3):** What stops them?
- **Value Perception (Q4):** What converts?

### 4. Get Recommendations

The skill provides:
- Context-specific CTA recommendations
- Universal vs. specialized strategy
- Persona segmentation opportunities
- A/B testing roadmap
- Friction elimination priorities

## Core Question Framework

**Q1: Action Intent**
"Which call-to-action would you most likely click/tap?"
→ Predicts clicks

**Q2: Motivation**
"What about it makes you want to take action?"
→ Reveals conversion drivers

**Q3: Friction Detection**
"Which CTA would you ignore? What makes you hesitate?"
→ Identifies barriers

**Q4: Value Perception**
"Which creates the strongest sense of value/urgency?"
→ Predicts actual conversion

## Testing Contexts

### 1. Landing Page Hero
- **User State:** New visitor, evaluating options
- **Goal:** Initial sign-up conversion
- **Test:** "Start Playing Free" vs "Join Now" vs "Get Started"

### 2. Registration Flow
- **User State:** Mid-registration, deciding to complete
- **Goal:** Reduce drop-off
- **Test:** "Create Account" vs "Continue" vs "Almost Done"

### 3. First Deposit
- **User State:** Registered, evaluating trust
- **Goal:** First deposit conversion
- **Test:** "Make First Deposit" vs "Add Funds" vs "Deposit & Play"

### 4. Promotional Email
- **User State:** Existing user, evaluating offer
- **Goal:** Engagement, promotional uptake
- **Test:** "Claim Bonus" vs "Get Offer" vs "Activate Now"

### 5. Re-engagement
- **User State:** Dormant user, considering return
- **Goal:** Reactivation
- **Test:** "Welcome Back" vs "Return & Play" vs "Come Back"

### 6. Mobile In-App
- **User State:** Active session, mid-activity
- **Goal:** Continued engagement
- **Test:** "Play Now" vs "Bet Now" vs "Go"

## Key Metrics

### Intent-to-Value Ratio
- **High Intent + High Value:** Ideal CTA ✅
- **High Intent + Low Value:** Clickbait ⚠️
- **Low Intent + High Value:** Hidden gem 💎
- **Low Intent + Low Value:** Failed CTA ❌

### Friction Coefficient
Count friction mentions per CTA:
- **0-2 mentions:** Low friction (good) ✅
- **3-5 mentions:** Moderate friction (fixable) ⚠️
- **6+ mentions:** High friction (rewrite) ❌

### Context Versatility
- **Universal:** Works in all contexts (rare)
- **Specialized:** Excels in specific context (common)
- **Context-Dependent:** Wildly varies (risky)

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Always test in specific context
- Vary persona state across rounds
- Randomize presentation order
- Record verbatim motivations
- Look for intent-value gaps
- Note all friction points
- Test device context (mobile vs desktop)
- Consider micro-copy around CTA

### ❌ Don't:
- Test CTAs in isolation
- Ignore value perception (Q4)
- Assume universal CTAs work
- Test too many at once (max 5)
- Skip friction analysis
- Forget mobile vs desktop differences
- Ignore persona hesitations

## Example Test Results

### Landing Page Hero CTA Test
**Tested:** 3 CTAs with 2 personas, 10 rounds each

**Results:**
- **"Start Playing Free"** won action intent (65%)
- **"Join the Community"** won value perception (75%)
- **Gap identified:** Clicks vs conversion misalignment

**Recommendation:** Use "Start Playing Free" for casual entertainers, "Join the Community" for cross-entertainment engagers

## Output You'll Get

1. **Quantitative Summary**
   - Vote counts per CTA
   - Percentages by persona
   - Context-specific performance
   - Intent-value gap analysis

2. **Qualitative Insights**
   - Why winners won (motivation themes)
   - Why losers lost (friction themes)
   - Persona-specific patterns
   - Context-fit analysis

3. **Strategic Recommendations**
   - Primary CTA per context
   - Universal vs specialized strategy
   - Segmentation opportunities
   - CTAs to avoid

4. **A/B Testing Roadmap**
   - High priority tests
   - Hypotheses to validate
   - Success metrics
   - Sample size estimates

## Integration

Works with all persona skills:
- `casual-entertainer` - Entertainment-focused CTAs
- `casino-explorer` - Discovery CTAs
- `sports-enthusiast` - Betting action CTAs
- `trust-seeker` - Security/trust CTAs
- `cross-entertainment-engager` - Integrated CTAs

Also works with:
- `synthetic-simulation-execution` - For large-scale automated testing

## Tips for Success

1. **Context is everything** - Never test CTAs without specific context
2. **Friction kills conversion** - Pay as much attention to Q3 as Q1
3. **Intent ≠ Conversion** - Q4 (value) predicts actual conversion better than Q1 (intent)
4. **Device matters** - Mobile CTAs need different approach than desktop
5. **Micro-copy matters** - Supporting text around CTA affects performance
6. **Validate with real tests** - Always A/B test winners before full rollout

## Example Usage

```
I want to test these 4 CTAs for our landing page hero section:

1. "Start Playing Free"
2. "Join Now & Play"
3. "Claim Your Bonus"
4. "Get Started"

Test with Casual Entertainer and Trust Seeker personas,
10 rounds each, mobile context.

Use the CTA testing skill.
```

## Next Steps

1. Identify what you need to optimize
2. List your CTA options
3. Define the specific context
4. Choose relevant personas
5. Run the systematic test
6. Analyze results
7. Implement recommendations
8. Validate with real A/B tests
