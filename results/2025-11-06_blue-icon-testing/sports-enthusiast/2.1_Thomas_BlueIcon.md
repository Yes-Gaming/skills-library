## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Professional. Solid. Nothing flashy.

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Trustworthy. Maybe a bit serious for gambling, but not bad. Doesn't get me hyped for match day though.

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Not really. Blends in with the sports apps I already have. Would need to remember where I put it.

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Trust. Reliable. Professional. Not exciting, but I'd probably feel safer using it than some flashy thing.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

3. It's fine. Trustworthy but not exciting.

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

Good if you want to look legit. Won't get my adrenaline going before a match though.
