## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Blue is what every betting company uses when they want to appear legitimate. It's the industry default. My first reaction is "here's another betting app trying to look trustworthy." Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's predictable.

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

In the gambling industry specifically, I'm suspicious when companies lean too hard on trust signals. Blue says "trust us," but as someone who covers this industry, I know that color choice alone doesn't make a company trustworthy. It's a superficial signal.

That said, blue is at least honest about what it's trying to communicate. It's not pretending to be something it's not—it's saying "we're a serious betting platform." I respect that more than flashy colors trying to manipulate excitement.

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

No. Most betting and financial apps are blue. If I'm looking for a specific app in a hurry, blue doesn't help—it's one of many. The branding and icon design would need to be very strong to overcome the fact that blue is everywhere in this category.

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Blue absolutely signals trust and legitimacy, which is important in gambling where there are legitimate concerns about predatory practices, hidden terms, and unlicensed operators. From that perspective, blue is a defensible choice—it's the color that says "we're playing by the rules."

But I'm also aware that companies use blue precisely because it has those associations, even when they don't deserve them. So blue can feel like camouflage for companies that aren't actually trustworthy. It's a double-edged sword.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

3. It's appropriate for the category, but it's also unremarkable. Blue won't hurt you, but it won't help you stand out either. If your actual operations are trustworthy and transparent, blue reinforces that. If they're not, blue is just window dressing.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

My concern with blue is that it's such a common choice in this industry that it feels like playing it safe rather than making a bold statement. Yes Games has the opportunity to differentiate itself, and blue doesn't do that. It blends into the category rather than standing out from it.

If you go with blue, make sure your actual practices—licensing, responsible gambling tools, payout transparency—back up what blue is promising. Otherwise, you're just another betting app wearing the same trustworthy costume as everyone else.
