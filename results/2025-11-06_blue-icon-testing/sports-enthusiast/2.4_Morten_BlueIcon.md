## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Hmm... blue? I mean, it's fine, but it doesn't really grab me. When I think about match day and that electric feeling, blue just doesn't match that energy at all. It's too calm!

---

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Honestly? It feels a bit flat. Sports betting is all about the RUSH—the tension, the excitement, the moment when your bet comes through and you just want to SCREAM! Blue doesn't capture any of that. It's like asking me to be calm and collected when I should be ON FIRE watching the game!

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Not really, no. I've got a bunch of blue apps—Messages, Twitter, all kinds of stuff. Blue just doesn't POP when I'm frantically trying to get my bet in before halftime ends. I need something that jumps out at me!

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Trust, I guess? Reliable? But where's the PASSION? Where's the intensity? Sports are emotional—they're about adrenaline and excitement and living in the moment. Blue feels like the opposite of that. It's too professional, too corporate. I want color that matches how I FEEL when my team scores!

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2. I don't hate it, but it just doesn't do it for me. It's missing that spark, that energy that makes betting on football so thrilling. Give me something that captures the emotion of the game, not something that looks like a banking app!

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

I think blue kills the vibe, man. Sports betting should feel alive, energetic, like you're part of the action. Blue makes it feel like a business transaction. Where's the heart? Where's the passion? That's what I want to see in a sports betting app!
