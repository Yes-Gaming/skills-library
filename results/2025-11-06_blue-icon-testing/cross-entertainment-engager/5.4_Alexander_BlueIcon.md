## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Uh... kinda boring? Blue doesn't really hit for entertainment content. Where's the energy?!

---

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Man, it feels OFF. When I'm streaming casino content or betting on esports, I want colors that match the HYPE and the energy! Blue is like... corporate? Professional? That's not what my audience wants to see when I'm showing them an all-in-one entertainment platform!

The whole point of having everything in one place is that it's EPIC and comprehensive and exciting! Blue doesn't communicate any of that. It looks like an app I'd use to check my bank balance, not to stream amazing entertainment content!

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Nah, definitely not! Blue apps are EVERYWHERE. When I'm about to start a stream or jump into content, I need the app to be RIGHT THERE, instantly recognizable. Blue just disappears into the sea of other apps. Not good for content creation!

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Trust, maybe? Professional vibes? But where's the FUN?! Where's the excitement that makes people want to engage with entertainment content?!

For streaming and content, the app icon needs to be visually interesting—something that pops on screen when I show it to my audience. Blue just sits there being boring and corporate. That's not shareable content!

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2. It's just... not it. For an all-in-one entertainment platform that should feel MASSIVE and comprehensive and exciting, blue is the opposite energy. Give me something that matches the hype of having sports, casino, and esports all in one place!

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

I think blue kills the energy for what could be an AMAZING platform story! Unified entertainment should feel like "wow, this is everything I need in one epic app!" Blue feels like "this is a professional service you should trust."

Wrong vibe! Give me colors that make me hyped to show my community! Blue ain't it!
