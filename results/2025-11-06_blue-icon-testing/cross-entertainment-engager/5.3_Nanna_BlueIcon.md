## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Blue feels like a safe default choice—which makes me skeptical. When a platform claims to be unified and integrated across multiple entertainment types, I want to see confidence and distinctiveness in the branding. Blue feels like they're hedging, trying to be everything to everyone and ending up being nothing special.

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

From a UX research perspective, blue is trying to solve for trust at the expense of engagement. That might make sense for a banking app, but for entertainment? It feels like the wrong priority. A unified entertainment platform should feel exciting and seamless, not just safe and professional.

Blue makes me question whether Yes Games actually understands what users want from cross-platform entertainment. We don't just want reliability—we want an experience that makes us excited to engage across different verticals.

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

No, and that's a real problem for a platform that's trying to be my primary entertainment destination. If I can't find it easily among all my other blue apps, how is it actually serving as my go-to hub? The UX of the app icon is the first touchpoint, and blue is already creating friction.

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Blue signals trust and professionalism, but it also signals "we're playing it safe." For a unified platform that's supposed to be innovative and comprehensive, playing it safe feels like a strategic failure. I want to see boldness and confidence in the positioning, not another blue app that looks like every other betting or finance platform.

From a user research standpoint, I'm skeptical that blue will resonate with users who are looking for a truly integrated entertainment experience. It's the color choice of companies that are afraid to make a statement.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2.5. It's not terrible, but it's disappointing. A unified entertainment platform has the opportunity to create a distinctive brand identity, and blue feels like a missed opportunity. It's safe, predictable, and forgettable—exactly what a differentiated platform shouldn't be.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

If Yes Games wants to position as a truly unified, innovative platform, I'd expect branding that reflects that ambition. Blue says "we're like everyone else but maybe slightly more trustworthy." That's not a compelling value proposition for a platform that's supposed to be rethinking entertainment.

Show me a color that says "we're building something new and better." Blue isn't that color.
