## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

The reason I immediately feel comfortable with blue is because it aligns with colors I already associate with trusted institutions—my banking apps, financial services, government sites. When I see blue in the gambling context, it signals to me that this is a platform that takes itself seriously, that operates with professionalism, and that likely adheres to regulatory requirements.

This is particularly important for someone like me who has seen the gambling industry evolve over decades. There are so many questionable operators out there, and blue immediately differentiates Yes Games as potentially more trustworthy.

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Blue makes me feel secure and reassured, which is exactly what I need when I'm putting my money into a gambling platform. I'm not looking for flashy excitement—I've been gambling responsibly for years, and what I value most is knowing that the platform is legitimate, that my winnings will be paid out, and that there are proper responsible gambling tools in place.

Blue communicates all of that to me. It says "we're not here to manipulate you with flashy colors and dopamine triggers—we're here to provide a secure, regulated entertainment experience." That's precisely the message I want to receive from a gambling platform at this stage of my life.

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

That's an interesting question because while blue might not be the most distinctive color on my home screen, what matters more to me is that it's recognizable as a trustworthy platform. When I'm looking for Yes Games, I'm not in a rush or looking for instant gratification—I'm methodically opening the app as part of my controlled entertainment routine.

So while blue may not "pop" the way yellow or red would, it creates the right association. When I do find it, I feel good about opening it because it visually aligns with my other trusted financial apps. That consistency actually reinforces my confidence in using it.

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Blue is strongly associated with trust, security, stability, and professionalism—all of which are paramount for me. At 52, I've learned to be skeptical of flashy marketing and bright colors that try to trigger impulsive behavior. Blue signals the opposite: calm, rational, trustworthy.

In terms of premium vs. cheap, blue can definitely feel premium if executed well. A rich, deep blue with sophisticated typography would communicate that this is a high-quality, professional platform. That's important because I want to feel like I'm using a premium service, not some budget operation cutting corners on security and compliance.

The fact that blue doesn't scream "fun!" or "exciting!" is actually a feature, not a bug, for my demographic. I don't need to be manipulated into feeling excited—I need to feel safe.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

I'd give it a 5. Blue is exactly what I want to see from a gambling platform that's targeting responsible, mature users. It signals trust, professionalism, and legitimacy—all non-negotiable qualities for me.

I know younger users might find it boring, but for someone in my demographic who has the disposable income and lifetime value that gambling platforms should be targeting, blue is the correct choice. It tells me that Yes Games respects its users and operates with integrity.

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

I think blue is a smart strategic choice if Yes Games wants to differentiate itself as the trustworthy, professional option in a market full of flashy, excitement-driven competitors. There's a significant segment of the market—myself included—that is actively looking for a gambling platform that doesn't feel predatory or manipulative.

Blue signals that Yes Games is that platform. It won't appeal to impulsive, excitement-seeking younger users, but it will appeal to mature, financially stable users who have higher lifetime value and lower churn rates. That's the demographic I'd be targeting if I were running a gambling business.

My only caveat is that the blue needs to be executed at a premium level—deep, rich tones with sophisticated design. A cheap-looking blue would undermine the trust signal. But if done well, blue is absolutely the right choice for positioning Yes Games as the mature, trustworthy alternative.
