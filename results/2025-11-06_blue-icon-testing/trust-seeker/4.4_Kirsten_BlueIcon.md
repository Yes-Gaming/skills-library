## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Oh, I like it! Blue feels safe and trustworthy—like this is a company that cares about doing things the right way. It makes me feel comfortable right from the start!

---

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

It makes me feel like I can have fun AND be safe at the same time! That's so important to me. I love the entertainment aspect of gambling—it's exciting and fun—but I also need to know that the platform is legitimate and won't take advantage of me.

Blue gives me both: it says "yes, we're fun, but we're also responsible and trustworthy." That balance is exactly what I'm looking for!

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Maybe not the fastest, but when I do see it, I'll feel good about opening it! It's like seeing a friend you trust—you know it's going to be a positive experience. That feeling of safety is more important to me than having the flashiest icon on my screen.

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Trust is the big one! Blue makes me think of banks, hospitals, companies that are regulated and professional. And in gambling, where there are so many concerns about fairness and safety, that trust is essential.

It also feels premium to me—like this is a quality platform that takes its responsibilities seriously. I'd much rather use a blue app that makes me feel safe than a flashy app that makes me worried about whether I'll actually get my winnings!

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

5! I absolutely love it! Blue is exactly what I want to see from a gambling platform. It tells me that Yes Games is trustworthy, professional, and cares about its users. I can have fun knowing that I'm in good hands!

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

I think blue is perfect for people like me who want to enjoy gambling as entertainment but need that reassurance that the platform is safe and legitimate. There are so many scary stories about gambling apps that don't pay out or that prey on vulnerable people—blue signals that Yes Games isn't one of those.

If I'm recommending an app to my friends, I'd feel much more comfortable recommending one with a blue icon because it shows that the company values trust and responsibility. That matters so much, especially for those of us who are more cautious!
