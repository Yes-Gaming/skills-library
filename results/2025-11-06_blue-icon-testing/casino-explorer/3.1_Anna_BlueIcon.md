## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Safe. Boring. Not visually exciting at all.

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Doesn't feel like gaming. Feels like work apps or banking. Not fun.

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

No. Too common. Would get lost with all the other blue apps.

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Trustworthy but bland. Professional, not playful. Definitely not fun.

2. Too boring for a casino app. Where's the visual appeal?

Not for me. Casino apps should look exciting and visually interesting. Blue doesn't do that.
