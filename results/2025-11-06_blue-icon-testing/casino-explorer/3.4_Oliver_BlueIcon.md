## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Uh... boring? Blue doesn't hit at all for a casino app. Where's the HYPE? Where's the energy?!

---

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Dude, it feels wrong! Casino games are about the RUSH, the visuals, the excitement! Blue is like... calming? Professional? That's not what I'm here for AT ALL. Give me something that matches the energy of hitting a big win, not something that looks like my email app!

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

No way! Blue gets lost in everything else. When I'm ready to stream some casino content or just play for fun, I want the app to JUMP out at me. Blue just sits there being all quiet and boring.

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Trust, maybe? Professional vibes? But where's the FUN? Where's the excitement and the visual pop?! Casino apps should feel EPIC, like you're about to experience something amazing. Blue feels like you're about to do your taxes!

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

1.5. It's just... wrong for the category. Casino gaming is about visual spectacle and excitement, and blue is the OPPOSITE of that. Total buzzkill!

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

Please don't do blue for a casino app. It kills the whole vibe! Give me colors that match the energy—something bold, something exciting, something that makes me want to click it! Blue makes me want to skip it and find something more fun!
