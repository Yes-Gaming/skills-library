## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Blue for a casino app feels like a costume. It's trying to look "legitimate" and "trustworthy" because the industry knows people are skeptical of gambling apps. But slapping blue on it doesn't actually make it trustworthy—it's just using color psychology to manipulate perception.

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Honestly? Suspicious. Casino games are designed to be addictive and psychologically manipulative. Using blue—the "trust" color—feels like another layer of manipulation. "Don't worry, we're professional and safe" while still running the same dopamine-driven games. It's cognitive dissonance.

Blue in this context reads as damage control. Like you're trying to make gambling look respectable and responsible when it's fundamentally about risk and reward-seeking behavior. I don't like that contradiction.

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

No, and honestly that might be strategic on your part. If the app blends in and doesn't stand out, maybe users forget it's a gambling app? Maybe it feels more "normal" sitting next to their banking and social media apps? That concerns me from a psychological manipulation standpoint.

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Blue screams "we want you to trust us" which immediately makes me wonder why you're trying so hard. Trustworthy companies don't need to dress themselves in trust colors—they earn trust through actions, transparency, and responsible practices.

Using blue feels like you're borrowing credibility from banks and financial institutions without actually operating like one. It's superficial trust signaling, and as someone who studies psychology, I see right through it.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2. I don't like the manipulation, even if it's subtler than flashy colors. Blue is just a different kind of psychological tactic—one that preys on people's need for security and trust rather than excitement. Both feel calculated to me.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

If you want to be trustworthy, prove it with actual policies—strong responsible gambling tools, transparent RTP, easy self-exclusion, prominent addiction resources. Don't just paint yourself blue and hope people associate you with legitimacy. That's lazy and manipulative brand strategy.
