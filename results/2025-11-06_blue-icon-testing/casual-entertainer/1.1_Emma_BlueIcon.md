## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Fine. Looks professional. Nothing special but not bad either.

---

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Safe, I guess. Maybe a bit boring compared to other gaming apps. Doesn't really scream "fun" to me, but it's not a dealbreaker.

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Not really. Lots of apps are blue. It would blend in more than stand out. I'd probably forget where I put it.

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Trust. Professional. Calm. Not exciting, though. Feels more like a banking app than a gaming app.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

3. It's fine. Nothing to hate, nothing to love. Just... blue.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

Eh, it's safe. Won't offend anyone but won't excite anyone either. Kind of forgettable.
