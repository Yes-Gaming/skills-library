## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Mmm... not gonna lie, blue feels kind of flat? Like it's not really saying anything to me. It's just... there. Not excited, not hyped, just... blue.

---

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Honestly? It feels like it's trying to be something it's not. Blue is what I'd expect from a banking app or something serious. For gaming, I want color that hits—something that makes me feel ALIVE. Blue just doesn't do that. It's too chill, too calm. Where's the energy?!

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Nah, probably not. I've got so many blue apps already. It would just disappear into the crowd. When I'm looking to jump into a game after work, I want something that POPS. Blue doesn't pop—it blends.

---

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Trust, I guess? Professional vibes? But definitely not fun. Not exciting. It's like... the opposite of what I'm looking for when I want to unwind and have a blast. Blue feels corporate, you know? Not playful.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2. It's just... meh. Not terrible, but not exciting either. I wouldn't download something because it's blue—I'd probably skip right over it looking for something more fun-looking.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

I think blue kills the vibe, honestly. Gaming should feel electric, fun, like something's about to go down. Blue feels like you're asking me to be calm and responsible. That's not what I'm here for! Give me color that matches the adrenaline, not the snooze button!
