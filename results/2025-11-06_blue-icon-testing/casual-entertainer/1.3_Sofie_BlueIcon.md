## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Blue? That's... safe. Almost too safe. It feels like someone in a boardroom said "what color won't offend anyone?" and landed on blue. I don't trust when brands play it that safe—it makes me wonder what they're hiding or what they're afraid of.

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Honestly? It feels wrong. Blue is what banks use. What corporate tools use. It's not fun, it's not exciting—it's the color of "trust us, we're serious." And maybe that's the point, but it feels like a gambling app trying to dress up in professional clothing to make you feel safer than you should.

Blue in this context feels like manipulation in the opposite direction—not "look how fun we are!" but "don't worry, we're legitimate." Both feel calculated.

---

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

No. Blue is everywhere. I probably have five blue apps on my main screen alone. It would blend right in, which I guess is fine if you don't want to be found easily. But if I'm looking for a gaming app, I'm probably skipping over the blue ones because they just don't register as entertainment.

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Trust. Corporate professionalism. Boredom. Blue says "we took a design class and learned that blue = trustworthy." It's formulaic. It doesn't feel authentic—it feels like a strategy.

And here's the thing: using blue to signal trust in a gambling app feels especially cynical to me. Like, "we know you're worried about getting scammed, so here's a blue icon to make you feel safe while we still take your money." I don't like it.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2. I don't hate it, but I don't buy it. It feels like a costume—dressing up gambling as something respectable. If you're going to make a gambling app, at least own what it is. Blue feels dishonest to me.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

I think blue is the color you choose when you're trying too hard to be taken seriously. It's overused, it's boring, and in this context, it feels like you're trying to convince me you're trustworthy rather than actually being trustworthy. That's a red flag for me.

If you want my trust, earn it with transparency, good policies, and user-first design—not by slapping blue on your icon and hoping I associate you with LinkedIn or PayPal.
