## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a blue app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Well, I think the first thing that comes to mind is that blue is very familiar. It's not necessarily a bad thing—blue has become almost a default in app design because it's so neutral and widely accepted. But from a UX perspective, when I see a blue app icon, I'm immediately thinking it needs to work harder to differentiate itself. Blue is everywhere—social media, productivity tools, communication apps. So my first reaction is "okay, this is safe, but is it memorable?"

**Q2: How does blue make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

The reason blue is interesting here is because it traditionally signals trust, stability, and professionalism—which are great qualities for, say, a financial app or a healthcare platform. But in gaming and entertainment, you want energy, excitement, playfulness. Blue can feel... subdued. It's calming, which might not be the emotional tone you want when someone's looking to have fun or feel that rush of entertainment.

That said, blue could work if you're positioning the app as a more sophisticated, trustworthy platform. If the goal is to say "we're not like those flashy, unreliable gambling apps," then blue makes sense. But if you want to capture that spontaneous, fun energy, blue might be working against you.

**Q3: Would blue help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Honestly, no—not unless the design execution is exceptional. When you look at the average iPhone home screen, blue is one of the most common colors. Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Outlook, Skype, Shazam, PayPal—there's a lot of blue out there. So purely from a recognition standpoint, blue blends in rather than stands out.

If Yes Games goes with blue, the logo design, typography, and icon shape will have to do the heavy lifting. The color alone won't be enough to create instant recognition the way a more uncommon color might.

**Q4: Does blue give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Blue is strongly associated with trust, reliability, and security. In color psychology, it's one of the most universally liked colors, which is why so many brands use it—it's low-risk. It also has associations with professionalism and calm.

In terms of premium vs. cheap, blue can go either way depending on the shade. A deep navy or rich cobalt can feel premium and sophisticated, while a lighter sky blue or electric blue might feel more casual or even dated depending on the execution.

What blue doesn't typically convey is energy, excitement, or fun—which are usually the emotional drivers for entertainment and gaming apps. So there's a bit of a mismatch there that would need to be addressed through other design elements.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a blue app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

I'd say a 3. It's not a bad choice—it's just a very safe choice. Blue won't alienate anyone, but it also won't create that visceral "wow" moment that makes an app feel exciting or different. From a design perspective, I think you could do better if the goal is to stand out in a crowded market.

**Q6: Any other thoughts about blue as our brand color for the app icon?**

The key question is: what do you want the app icon to communicate? If the answer is trust, stability, and professionalism—especially if you're targeting an older or more risk-averse demographic—then blue makes perfect sense. But if you want to signal fun, energy, and entertainment, blue might be holding you back.

I think there's a reason most gaming and entertainment apps avoid blue—it just doesn't align with the emotional tone of the category. But if Yes Games wants to differentiate by being the "trustworthy" option in a sea of flashy competitors, then blue could be strategic. It all depends on the positioning.
