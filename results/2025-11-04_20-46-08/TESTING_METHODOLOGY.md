## Testing Protocol

### PHASE 1: Sequential Individual Testing (Bias-Free)

**Objective:** Capture individual reactions to each logo without comparison bias

**Method:**
- Show logos ONE AT A TIME in RANDOM ORDER (different order per respondent)
- Each respondent sees all 7 logos sequentially
- Complete isolation between tests (no context pollution)
- No logos shown together until Phase 2

**Questions (per logo):**

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
1. What's the first word or feeling that comes to mind?
2. What kind of company do you think this is?
3. How much would you trust a company with this logo? (1-5 scale)
4. How modern or dated does it look? (1-5 scale)
5. Does it feel premium, mass-market, or budget?

**B. Recognition & Recall**
(Asked after showing 2-3 logos)
6. Which logos do you remember best without seeing them again?

**C. Fit & Relevance**
7. Does it feel right for an iGaming/betting/entertainment company? (1-5 scale)
8. What kind of player or audience do you imagine uses this brand?

**D. Open Commentary**
9. What works / doesn't work for you about this design?

### PHASE 2: Comparative Testing (All Logos Side-by-Side)

**Objective:** Understand relative preferences and competitive positioning

**Method:**
- Show ALL 7 LOGOS together in RANDOM ORDER
- Same respondent views all logos simultaneously
- Fresh agent instance (separate from Phase 1)
- Direct comparison questions

**Questions:**

1. **Preference:** Which logo do you like the most? Why?
2. **Trust:** Which one feels most trustworthy?
3. **Standout:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or ad?
4. **Brand Fit:** Which one do you think represents "Play Made Easy" best?
5. **Conversion Intent:** If this were a betting app, which logo would make you download or try it first?
6. **Ranking:** Rank your top 3 favorites (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

## Execution Approach

### Context Isolation Protocol
- Each test runs in completely separate agent instance
- No memory or context pollution between tests
- Random logo order per respondent (prevents position bias)
- Variation profile loaded fresh for each test

### Persona Variation Generation
Each of the 10 variations within a persona includes:
- **Unique demographic details** (specific age, location, occupation)
- **Distinct behavioral patterns** (gambling habits, device preferences)
- **Individual psychographics** (motivations, concerns, risk tolerance)
- **Personal background story** (how they discovered gambling, experiences)
- **Unique communication style** (brief/direct, detailed, skeptical, enthusiastic, analytical, etc.)
- **Survey response voice** (natural language patterns, expressions)

### Response Styles Represented (across 10 variations):
1. Brief/Direct (concise, to-the-point)
2. Detailed/Explanatory (walks through reasoning)
3. Skeptical/Critical (calls out issues)
4. Enthusiastic/Emotional (passionate responses)
5. Analytical/Comparative (data-driven thinking)
6. Storytelling (relates to personal experiences)
7. Practical/Usability-focused (functional perspective)
8. Social/Influenced (considers peer opinions)
9. Uncertain/Hedging (less confident, tentative)
10. Confident/Decisive (clear, strong opinions)

## Statistical Validity

With 50 unique synthetic individuals:
- **30+ choosing same logo** = Strong signal (60%+)
- **25-29 choosing same logo** = Moderate signal (50-58%)
- **20-24 choosing same logo** = Weak signal (40-48%)
- **<20 choosing same logo** = No clear winner (<40%)

**Persona-Level (n=10 per persona):**
- **8-10 agree** = High consensus (80-100%)
- **6-7 agree** = Moderate consensus (60-70%)
- **4-5 agree** = Split opinion (40-50%)
- **<4 agree** = No consensus (<40%)

## Testing Timeline

- **Setup & Persona Generation:** ~30 minutes
- **Phase 1 Execution:** ~60-90 minutes (50 isolated tests)
- **Phase 2 Execution:** ~45-60 minutes (50 isolated tests)
- **Analysis & Documentation:** ~45-60 minutes
