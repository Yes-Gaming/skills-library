## Test Responses

### Q1: Which of these three is your clear winner? Why?

Um, I think maybe Logo B? I'm not entirely sure, but it seems the safest choice?

I guess Logo B feels less intimidating than the others. The lowercase makes it feel gentler somehow, less aggressive. Logo A with that shadow feels kind of intense, and Logo C with the tilt feels like it's trying to make gambling seem more exciting than it maybe should be?

I don't know... I'm worried about gambling in general, so maybe I prefer the one that doesn't try to make it seem super thrilling? Logo B feels calmer, I think. But I could be wrong about that.

### Q2: Which feels most trustworthy?

I think maybe Logo B? Though I'm not really sure how to judge trustworthiness from a logo...

It's just that Logo B looks more professional and clean. Like something a real company would have? Logo A seems okay too, but that shadow thing makes me wonder if they're trying to make it seem more impressive than it actually is. Logo C feels too playful for something involving money, maybe?

But honestly, I don't really trust gambling apps in general, so "most trustworthy" is relative. I guess Logo B worries me the least? If that makes sense?

### Q3: Which feels most modern and premium?

I think Logo B seems most modern? It has that clean, simple look that I see on a lot of newer apps.

Premium... I'm not sure. I guess Logo B could be premium? The refined look makes it seem more expensive or high-quality. But I don't know if I want a gambling app to feel "premium" - doesn't that mean it might encourage spending more money?

Maybe Logo A could be premium too with that shadow effect? I'm really not sure. Logo C seems more fun than premium.

I'm probably overthinking this...

### Q4: Which fits iGaming/betting best?

Um... this is hard. I don't really know what gambling apps are supposed to look like since I barely use them.

Maybe Logo A? It has that bold, strong look that I associate with betting, I think. Or maybe Logo C because it seems more playful and game-like?

But then again, maybe Logo B fits better if the company wants to seem more responsible and trustworthy? I read somewhere that gambling companies should promote responsible gambling, so maybe the calmer logo is better?

I honestly don't know. They all could work, maybe? Sorry, I'm not very helpful with this question.

### Q5: Rank all 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning

**1st Place: Logo B (Lowercase "yes" refined)**

I think this is my favorite, though I'm not 100% certain. It just feels... safer? Less aggressive?

The clean design makes it seem more trustworthy and professional. I like that it's not trying to be exciting or flashy - that actually makes me feel better about it. When gambling apps try to look super exciting, it makes me nervous that they're trying to get people to spend more money.

The lowercase "yes" feels gentler and more approachable. It doesn't feel like it's shouting at me to play. It's just... there. Calm. That's probably a good thing for something that could potentially be addictive?

I could be totally wrong about this, but Logo B makes me feel least anxious out of the three options.

**2nd Place: Logo A (Bold "YES" with shadow)**

I guess this would be my second choice? It seems professional enough with the bold lettering. The shadow adds some dimension, which could be nice?

But I'm a bit uncertain about it. The shadow effect makes it feel like it's trying to stand out and grab attention, which makes me a little uncomfortable. Is it trying too hard? I don't know.

It's not bad, necessarily. It looks like what I think a gambling app logo might look like. But that also means it doesn't really differentiate itself or make me feel any better about using gambling apps.

It's fine, I guess? Middle of the road. Not exciting, not worrying. Just... okay.

**3rd Place: Logo C (Bold "YES" tilted stamp)**

I'm putting this last, though I feel bad about it because it's actually kind of fun and creative.

The problem is that the playfulness worries me a bit. The tilt and stamp effect make gambling seem really fun and casual, like it's no big deal. But isn't gambling actually kind of serious since it involves real money and potential risks?

I worry that Logo C might make gambling feel too casual and easy, which could be dangerous for people who have problems with impulse control (like me, sometimes). The tilt gives it this energetic, spontaneous feel that might encourage impulsive playing.

Maybe that's me projecting my own concerns onto it, but that's how it makes me feel. I'd probably be more hesitant to use an app with Logo C because it feels like it's making gambling seem too carefree.

Again, I could be completely wrong about this interpretation.

### Q6: What makes your #1 better than your #2?

Um, I think it's mostly about how they make me feel?

Logo B feels calm and controlled, while Logo A feels more attention-grabbing and intense. Given my concerns about gambling - spending too much, getting too caught up in it - I think I prefer the calmer option.

The shadow in Logo A kind of bothers me. I'm not sure why exactly... maybe because it feels like the logo is trying to seem more substantial or important than it needs to be? Like it's adding extra emphasis to get attention? That makes me slightly distrustful, I think.

Logo B doesn't have any of those extra effects. It's just clean typography. That simplicity feels more honest to me. Like they're confident enough in what they're offering that they don't need visual tricks.

But I could be reading too much into this. Maybe the shadow is just a design choice and doesn't mean anything deeper. I tend to overthink things.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that Logo B feels less manipulative to me? Though I'm not certain that's the right word. It just feels more straightforward and less like it's trying to influence my emotions or behavior.

For someone like me who's already anxious about gambling, that matters.
