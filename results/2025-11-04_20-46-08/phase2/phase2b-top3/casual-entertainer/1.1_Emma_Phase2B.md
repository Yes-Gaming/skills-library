## Test Responses

### Q1: Which of these three is your clear winner? Why?

Logo A.

Clean. Simple. Easy to read on my phone. The other two try too hard.

### Q2: Which feels most trustworthy?

Logo A.

Looks professional. Not flashy.

### Q3: Which feels most modern and premium?

Logo A.

Definitely more modern than the others. Premium without being snobby.

### Q4: Which fits iGaming/betting best?

Logo B.

The shadow thing makes it feel more like gambling. But I still prefer A overall.

### Q5: Rank all 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning

**1st Place: Logo A (Lowercase "yes" refined)**
Clean, modern, doesn't annoy me. Easy to see on my phone screen after a long shift. Doesn't feel like it's screaming at me.

**2nd Place: Logo B (Bold "YES" with shadow)**
It's fine. The shadow is a bit much but at least it's not tilted weird.

**3rd Place: Logo C (Bold "YES" tilted stamp)**
Don't like the tilt. Makes it harder to read quickly. Feels gimmicky.

### Q6: What makes your #1 better than your #2?

Logo A is cleaner. Logo B has that shadow effect that feels unnecessary. When I'm tired on Friday night, I just want something simple and easy. Logo A does that. Logo B feels like it's trying to be exciting when I just want it to work.
