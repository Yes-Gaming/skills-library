## Test Responses

### Q1: Which of these three is your clear winner? Why?

I think most people would go with Logo A, and honestly, that's what I'd pick too.

Everyone I know is really into that clean, minimal aesthetic right now - like, all the apps we use daily (Spotify, Instagram, TikTok) have moved toward cleaner, simpler logos. Logo A fits that trend perfectly.

My friends would definitely say Logo A looks the most "legit" and professional. It's got that tech startup vibe that people trust. When I show this to my friend group, I bet they'd all pick Logo A because it looks like something that would actually be successful and popular.

Logo C might get some love for being different and playful, but I think most people would find it a bit too quirky. Logo B just looks kind of standard and maybe a bit outdated?

### Q2: Which feels most trustworthy?

Everyone I know would probably say Logo A feels most trustworthy.

It's got that clean, transparent look that all the apps people trust have. Like, when you think about payment apps or banking apps or any app where you're putting in money, they all have that refined, minimal aesthetic. Logo A matches that.

People I know are pretty skeptical of flashy, aggressive branding in the gambling space. Logo B with the shadow feels like it's trying too hard. Logo C is fun but maybe too casual for handling money?

I think most people's trust signals are calibrated toward clean, modern design these days.

### Q3: Which feels most modern and premium?

Oh, definitely Logo A. Everyone's into that minimalist premium aesthetic right now.

If you look at what's trending on social media and what brands people my age actually engage with, it's all about refined simplicity. Logo A has that elevated, sophisticated vibe that people associate with premium.

People I know would see Logo A and think "oh, this is one of those well-designed new apps" whereas Logo B would be like "okay, standard gambling site" and Logo C would be "interesting but maybe trying too hard to be different?"

The lowercase thing is super on-trend too. All the cool new brands are doing lowercase wordmarks.

### Q4: Which fits iGaming/betting best?

Hmm, this is interesting because I think there's a split between what fits traditional gambling and what my friend group would actually use.

Logo B probably fits what most people EXPECT from gambling - bold, aggressive, that shadow effect. Traditional iGaming aesthetic.

But honestly? My friends and I don't really use those old-school gambling sites. They feel sketchy and outdated. We'd be more likely to try something that looks like Logo A - modern, clean, trustworthy. Something we could actually talk about without feeling weird.

So I guess Logo B fits old iGaming, but Logo A fits where iGaming is going and what people my age would actually use.

### Q5: Rank all 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning

**1st Place: Logo A (Lowercase "yes" refined)**

Everyone I know would pick this one, and I agree with them. It's got all the things people look for in apps right now:

- Clean, modern design that fits with other apps on your phone
- Feels trustworthy and professional without being corporate and boring
- Premium aesthetic that makes you feel like you're using something quality
- Would look good when you screenshot and share wins with friends
- Fits the overall vibe of what apps should look like in 2025

When I think about recommending an app to my friends, I want it to be something that looks legit and modern. Logo A checks all those boxes. It's the kind of logo that would make people think "oh, this is a well-designed app" rather than "sketchy gambling site."

Also, from a social media perspective, Logo A would work great in content. Clean, readable, professional-looking. If I were posting about it on Instagram stories or TikTok, Logo A would look the best.

**2nd Place: Logo C (Bold "YES" tilted stamp)**

Some people in my friend group would actually really like this one! It's got personality and stands out.

I could see this being popular with people who are into streetwear, sneaker culture, or that whole sticker/patch aesthetic that's trendy. The stamp thing is kind of cool and different.

But I think most people would find it a bit too quirky or gimmicky. It's memorable for sure, but maybe not in the way you want? Like, it's the kind of logo that starts conversations, which could be good or bad.

I'd worry that people might not take it seriously enough. Like, it's fun, but when you're dealing with money, do you want "fun" or do you want "trustworthy professional"? Most people I know would lean toward the latter.

**3rd Place: Logo B (Bold "YES" with shadow)**

This one's fine, but nobody would really talk about it. It's just... there.

People I know wouldn't have strong opinions either way. It's not bad, but it's not interesting. The shadow effect feels kind of dated - like design from 5-10 years ago. Everyone's moved on from that style.

It would work, sure, but it wouldn't excite anyone or make anyone want to share it or talk about it. In the social media age, you kind of need branding that people want to engage with. Logo B is too generic for that.

Also, if I'm being honest, people my age are pretty influenced by what looks "cool" and "modern" on social media. Logo B doesn't really have that shareable quality. Logo A does. Even Logo C does in a quirky way. Logo B is just kind of forgettable.

### Q6: What makes your #1 better than your #2?

I think most people would say it comes down to credibility and shareability.

Logo A has credibility - it looks like a real, professional, well-funded app. The kind of thing that would be featured in the App Store or that tech blogs would write about. People trust brands that look like Logo A.

Logo C has personality but maybe not credibility. It's fun and different, but some people might question if it's actually a serious, trustworthy platform. The playfulness could work against it when you're dealing with money.

From a social perspective, Logo A is the safer recommendation. If I tell my friends to try an app with Logo A, they'll trust my judgment. If I recommend an app with Logo C, they might be like "uh, this looks kinda weird, are you sure it's legit?"

Also, Logo A would age better. Clean, minimal design is pretty timeless - or at least as timeless as things get in the fast-moving design world. Logo C feels more trendy, which means it might feel dated faster.

Everyone I know has developed pretty good instincts for what apps look "legit" vs "sketchy," and Logo A hits all the "legit" markers while Logo C, despite being cool, has some elements that might trigger "is this serious?" questions.

In social contexts, credibility > personality for apps involving money.
