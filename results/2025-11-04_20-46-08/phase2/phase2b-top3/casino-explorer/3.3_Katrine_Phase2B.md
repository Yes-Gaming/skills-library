## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
Logo A, though I'm critical of all gambling branding.

Logo B's shadow is a classic psychological manipulation technique - adding artificial weight and authority. Logo C's playful tilt is designed to make gambling feel casual and fun, downplaying real risks.

Logo A at least shows restraint from obvious manipulation tactics. Clean typography without tricks to influence emotions or perception.

### Q2: Trustworthy?
Logo A is least manipulative, which makes it most trustworthy in gambling context.

As a psychology student, I recognize how Logo B's shadow creates false authority and Logo C's tilt casualizes serious financial activity. Both are problematic.

Logo A doesn't use those psychological tricks. It's just honest typography.

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo A is objectively most modern and premium by design standards.

But I question whether gambling should feel "premium" - that's often designed to encourage higher spending.

### Q4: Fits iGaming?
Logo B fits what people expect from gambling - aggressive, bold, manipulative design.

Logo A breaks from those predatory patterns. If gambling companies were actually responsible, they'd use less manipulative branding like Logo A.

### Q5: Rankings
1st: Logo A - Least psychologically manipulative
2nd: Logo B - Transparent about what it is (aggressive gambling)
3rd: Logo C - Dangerous casualization of gambling

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo A shows restraint from manipulation tactics. Logo B uses shadow to create unearned authority - classic persuasion technique. I trust brands that don't exploit psychological vulnerabilities.

**Winner:** Logo A (Lowercase "yes") - Least manipulative
