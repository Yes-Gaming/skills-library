## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
I think maybe Logo C? Though I'm not completely sure.

The lowercase feels less aggressive and intimidating. Logo A with the shadow seems kind of intense, and Logo B with the tilt makes gambling seem too playful and casual, which worries me.

Logo C feels calmer, which I guess is better? But I could be wrong about that.

### Q2: Trustworthy?
Logo C seems most trustworthy, I think? It's straightforward without tricks.

Logo A's shadow makes me wonder if it's trying to seem more important than it is. Logo B feels too casual for handling money.

But honestly, I don't fully trust any gambling apps, so it's all relative.

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo C looks most modern with that clean design.

Premium... I'm not sure. Maybe Logo C? Though I worry that "premium" in gambling means expensive, which makes me uncomfortable.

### Q4: Fits iGaming?
I don't really know what gambling apps should look like since I barely use them.

Maybe Logo A is more traditional? But perhaps Logo C is better if they want to seem responsible and safe?

I'm really not sure.

### Q5: Rankings
1st: Logo C - Least intimidating, calmer
2nd: Logo A - Professional but intense
3rd: Logo B - Too playful, makes gambling seem too casual

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo C feels less manipulative maybe? The shadow in Logo A seems like it's trying to create false importance, which makes me a bit distrustful.

For someone worried about spending too much, the quieter option feels safer. I think.

**Winner:** Logo C (Lowercase "yes") - Least intimidating
