## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
Logo B reminds me of collecting stamps in my travel journal. There's something personal and adventurous about that stamp aesthetic.

When I was backpacking through Southeast Asia, I collected these visa stamps - each one had character and told a story. Logo B has that same energy. It feels like an adventure, like saying "YES" to new experiences.

Logo A is beautiful but doesn't have a soul. Logo C feels corporate.

### Q2: Trustworthy?
There's this quote I love - "authenticity builds trust." Logo B feels authentic and handmade, like someone actually cared about making it unique.

I remember this small casino I visited in Macau - family-run, had this handmade charm. Logo B has that authentic quality. Logo A is too polished, Logo C tries too hard.

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo A is modern-minimal. Logo B is modern-experiential.

The best experiences I've had traveling weren't at five-star hotels - they were at places with character and story. Logo B has that character-driven premium quality.

### Q4: Fits iGaming?
Logo B makes gambling feel like an adventure, like exploring new games and experiences. That's what casino gaming should be!

The stamp vibe says "collect experiences, try new games" - perfect for casino exploration. Logo A is too restrained, Logo C is too corporate.

### Q5: Rankings
1st: Logo B - Authentic adventure energy, personal character
2nd: Logo A - Quality craft but no story
3rd: Logo C - Corporate, soulless

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo B tells a story of adventure and saying YES to experiences. Logo A is technically perfect but emotionally empty. In my travels, I've learned that perfect is boring - character is memorable. Logo B has character.

**Winner:** Logo B (Tilted stamp) - Authentic adventure story
