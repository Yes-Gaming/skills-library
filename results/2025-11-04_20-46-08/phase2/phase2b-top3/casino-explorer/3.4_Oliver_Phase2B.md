## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
LOGO A! YES! The tilted stamp is SO cool! It's got that energy and personality!

The tilt makes it feel dynamic and exciting - perfect for casino gaming! Logo B is fine but kinda standard. Logo C is too calm for casino games - where's the fun?!

Logo A would look SICK as an app icon! Super eye-catching and different!

### Q2: Trustworthy?
Logo C looks most "professional" but that's boring. Logo A feels trustworthy in a different way - it's honest about being FUN! It's not pretending to be some serious corporate thing!

I trust brands that own what they are. Logo A owns being playful and exciting!

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo C is "premium" in that Apple minimalist way. Logo A is premium in that streetwear, gaming, trendy way!

For casino gaming, I prefer the exciting premium vibe! Logo A has that energy!

### Q4: Fits iGaming?
Logo A is PERFECT for casino gaming! The playful energy, the bold YES, the stamp vibe - it all screams FUN GAMES! That's what casino apps should be!

Logo C is too quiet. Logo B is closer but still kinda standard. Logo A is the winner!

1st: Logo A - MAXIMUM personality and gaming energy!
2nd: Logo B - Has some energy but feels standard
3rd: Logo C - Beautiful but too quiet for casino games

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo A has WAY more personality! Logo B is just bold text with shadow - I've seen that a million times. Logo A is unique and memorable! That tilt, that stamp effect - it's DIFFERENT! And in gaming, different = better!

**Winner:** Logo A (Tilted stamp) - Maximum gaming energy!
