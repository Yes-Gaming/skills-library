## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
Logo C. Obviously.

Premium design execution, modern aesthetic, professional quality. That's what high-end casino platforms should look like.

Logo B is acceptable but conventional. Logo A is gimmicky and undermines premium positioning.

### Q2: Trustworthy?
Logo C. Absolutely.

Quality execution and design restraint build trust. Logo C demonstrates both. Logo B tries to add false weight with shadow. Logo A's playfulness doesn't inspire confidence for significant transactions.

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo C is clearly the most premium. Refined typography, contemporary aesthetic, sophisticated restraint.

I expect premium quality from the platforms I use. Logo C delivers that. Logo B is dated, Logo A is too casual.

### Q4: Fits iGaming?
Logo C fits premium casino gaming. Clean, sophisticated, professional.

Logo B fits traditional casino. Logo A fits casual gaming. I play at premium levels - Logo C is the only appropriate choice.

### Q5: Rankings
1st: Logo C - Premium execution, modern sophisticated design
2nd: Logo B - Functional but lacks premium positioning
3rd: Logo A - Inappropriate casualness for premium gaming

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo C demonstrates design excellence and premium positioning. Logo B is adequate but doesn't communicate high-quality platform. For high-stakes gaming, branding quality matters. Logo C wins decisively.

**Winner:** Logo C (Lowercase "yes") - Premium quality
