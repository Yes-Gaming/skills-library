## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
Logo C works best for quick gaming sessions.

Clean, easy to read, loads fast, works at small sizes. During my 15-minute breaks, I need apps that are efficient and clear. Logo C delivers.

Logo A's tilt makes it harder to read quickly. Logo B's shadow adds unnecessary complexity.

### Q2: Trustworthy?
Logo C feels most straightforward and honest. No visual tricks.

Practically speaking, I need to trust the app will work quickly during my short breaks. Simple design suggests reliable function.

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo C is most modern - clean, refined, contemporary.

For an app I use during work breaks, modern and efficient matters more than flashy effects.

### Q4: Fits iGaming?
Logo C fits modern mobile casino gaming. Clean interface, quick loading, easy navigation.

Logo B fits old casino style. Logo A is too complicated for quick sessions.

### Q5: Rankings
1st: Logo C - Best for quick, efficient mobile gaming
2nd: Logo B - Functional but unnecessary complexity
3rd: Logo A - Tilt reduces quick readability

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo C is optimized for mobile efficiency. Logo B has decorative elements (shadow) that don't improve usability. For time-limited gaming sessions, efficient > decorative.

**Winner:** Logo C (Lowercase "yes") - Optimal mobile efficiency
