**Test ID:** PHASE2B-025 | **Date:** November 5, 2025 | **Phase:** 2B

## Respondent: Caroline (3.5 - Analytical/Comparative)
Age 29 | Mathematics teacher | RTP-focused 300-500 DKK/month

**Logos:** A: Bold shadow "YES" | B: Lowercase "yes" | C: Tilted stamp "YES"

## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
Analyzing across evaluation criteria, Logo B scores highest.

Comparing design metrics:
- Clarity: B(10) > A(8) > C(6)
- Professional: B(10) > A(7) > C(5)
- Modern: B(10) > C(7) > A(5)
- Trust: B(9) > A(7) > C(6)

3rd: Logo C - Style over substance, functional deficits

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo B demonstrates design sophistication and strategic positioning value. Logo A delivers category fit but limited differentiation. Mathematical analysis favors Logo B's superior execution and positioning ROI.

**Winner:** Logo B (Lowercase "yes") - Analytical superiority
