**Test ID:** PHASE2B-019 | **Date:** November 5, 2025 | **Phase:** 2B

## Respondent: Simon (2.9 - Uncertain/Hedging)

**Logos:** A: Tilted stamp "YES" | B: Lowercase "yes" | C: Bold shadow "YES"

## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
Um, I think maybe Logo B? I'm not entirely sure though.

The lowercase feels less aggressive than the others, which I guess is better? Logo C with the shadow feels kind of intense, and Logo A with the tilt seems like it's trying to make betting seem more fun than it maybe should be.

I worry about gambling in general, so maybe the calmer one is better? But I could be wrong.

### Q2: Trustworthy?
I think Logo B seems most trustworthy? Though I'm not really sure how to judge that from a logo.

Logo C looks professional but that shadow makes me wonder if it's trying too hard. Logo A feels too playful for something involving money.

But honestly, I don't fully trust any betting platforms, so... it's relative?

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo B seems most modern, I think. It has that clean look that newer apps have.

Premium... I don't know. Maybe Logo B? Though I'm not sure betting apps should feel "premium" - doesn't that encourage spending more?

### Q4: Fits iGaming?
I'm really not sure. Maybe Logo C fits what betting sites usually look like? But I barely use them, so I don't know.

Perhaps Logo B is better if they want to seem responsible? I read that gambling companies should promote responsible gambling.

### Q5: Rankings
1st: Logo B - Feels safest and least aggressive
2nd: Logo C - Professional but intense
3rd: Logo A - Too playful, makes gambling seem too casual

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo B feels calmer and less manipulative, I think. Logo C's shadow adds emphasis that feels like it's trying to grab attention, which makes me a bit uncomfortable.

For someone worried about impulse control, the quieter option seems better. Maybe.

**Winner:** Logo B (Lowercase "yes") - Least intimidating
