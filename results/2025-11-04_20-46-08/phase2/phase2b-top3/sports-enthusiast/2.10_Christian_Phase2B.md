## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
Logo B. Absolutely.

Bold, professional, authoritative. Exactly what a serious betting platform needs. The shadow adds presence without being excessive. Clear winner.

Logo C is too minimal for sports betting. Logo A is gimmicky with the tilt.

### Q2: Trustworthy?
Logo B. Definitely.

The bold, substantial design conveys confidence and reliability. Professional execution. This is what credibility looks like in the betting space.

Logo C looks professional too but lacks the authority needed. Logo A undermines trust with playful aesthetics.

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo C is more "modern" in the tech sense. Logo B is premium in the sports betting sense.

For this category, Logo B's authoritative premium is more appropriate than Logo C's minimalist premium. Different contexts require different aesthetics.

Obviously Logo B.

### Q4: Fits iGaming?
Logo B fits perfectly. Bold, confident, professional - exactly what serious sports betting requires.

Logo C is too gentle. Logo A is too quirky. Logo B is the clear category fit.

### Q5: Rankings
1st: Logo B - Perfect combination of professionalism and impact
2nd: Logo C - Quality design but wrong energy level
3rd: Logo A - Gimmicky, undermines seriousness

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo B has the authority and presence that sports betting demands. Logo C is elegant but lacks necessary boldness.

When you're betting significant amounts on football, you want a platform that looks as confident as you feel. Logo B delivers that. Logo C doesn't.

**Winner:** Logo B (Bold shadow) - Professional authority
