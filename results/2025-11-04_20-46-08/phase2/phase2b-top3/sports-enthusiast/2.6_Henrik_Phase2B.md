## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
Logo C reminds me of my father's old football pools coupons. There's something about that bold, shadowed text that feels authentic to betting tradition.

Back when I was a kid, my dad would fill out these pools every weekend before the Superliga matches. The forms had this bold, authoritative typography - serious, substantial. Logo C has that same gravitas. It respects the tradition of football betting.

Logo A is beautiful but feels disconnected from betting heritage. Logo B tries too hard to be contemporary-quirky.

### Q2: Trustworthy?
My grandfather always said "trust comes from consistency, not flash." Logo C has that dependable, established feel. The bold design says "we've been here, we know what we're doing."

There's a story about trust - when I first started betting, I used this site with flashy graphics. Lost more than I wanted. Now I trust brands that look professional and grounded. Logo C has that quality.

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo A is modern in that tech-startup way. But is that what we want for football betting?

I remember when sports bars started getting flat screens - some tradition was lost. Logo C feels premium in a traditional sports sense - authoritative, substantial, like Sky Sports or ESPN branding.

### Q4: Fits iGaming?
Logo C fits perfectly. It's like when you walk into a proper bookmaker's - you want to see confident, professional branding, not minimalist tech or quirky stickers. Logo C has that established betting atmosphere.

### Q5: Rankings
1st: Logo C - Respects betting tradition, authoritative
2nd: Logo A - Quality design but wrong heritage
3rd: Logo B - Tries too hard to be different

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo C tells the right story. It connects to football betting heritage. Logo A tells a tech story. For something as traditional as betting on football, I want the brand that understands where it came from.

**Winner:** Logo C (Bold shadow) - Authentic betting tradition
