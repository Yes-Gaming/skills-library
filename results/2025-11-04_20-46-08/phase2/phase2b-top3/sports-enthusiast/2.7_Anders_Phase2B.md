## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
From a practical standpoint, Logo A works best for sports betting use cases.

Functionally: bold text is readable at small sizes during live matches, shadow adds enough contrast to register quickly, all-caps "YES" processes fast when you're rushing to place a bet before odds change.

Logo C is cleaner but too subtle for time-pressured betting. Logo B's tilt creates unnecessary reading friction.

### Q2: Trustworthy?
Logo A and C both feel trustworthy. Logo A shows confidence, Logo C shows professionalism. Both work. Logo B feels less serious with the playful tilt.

For functionality, trust needs to be immediate. Logo A's bold presence creates instant credibility.

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo C is more modern by design standards. Logo A is more functional for sports betting.

Practically, I'd rather have functional than trendy. Logo A delivers what's needed.

### Q4: Fits iGaming?
Logo A fits perfectly. Bold, clear, fast to recognize. When you're trying to bet during a live match, these practical factors matter more than aesthetic trends.

Logo C is too quiet. Logo B is too complicated with the tilt.

### Q5: Rankings
1st: Logo A - Best functional performance for sports betting
2nd: Logo C - Quality design, but lacks necessary impact
3rd: Logo B - Tilt reduces usability

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo A is optimized for actual use conditions - quick recognition, time pressure, multitasking during matches. Logo C is optimized for aesthetic appeal.

For sports betting, function > aesthetics. Logo A wins.

**Winner:** Logo A (Bold shadow) - Superior functional usability
