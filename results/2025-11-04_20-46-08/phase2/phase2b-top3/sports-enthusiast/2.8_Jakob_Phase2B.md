When we share our bet slips on our group chat, Logo C would look coolest. It's got personality and would make good content for Instagram stories.

Logo A is too corporate. Logo B is solid but forgettable.

But Logo C has a different kind of trust - like indie brand trust. My friends would see it as authentic and different from corporate betting sites.

Logo A is "premium" in that Apple way. Logo C is "premium" in that Supreme/streetwear way.

Most people in my circle would find Logo C more interesting. The tilt and stamp effect are on-trend.
