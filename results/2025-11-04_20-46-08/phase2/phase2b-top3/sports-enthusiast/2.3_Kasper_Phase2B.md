## Test Responses

### Q1: Winner?

Logo B. It's the only one that doesn't use typical gambling industry manipulation tactics.

Logo A with the shadow is classic aggressive betting aesthetic - designed to create false authority. Logo C with the tilt is trying to make gambling feel casual and fun, downplaying the risks. Both are problematic from an ethical standpoint.

Logo B at least shows restraint. Clean typography without psychological tricks.

### Q2: Most trustworthy?

Logo B, though "trust" in gambling branding is questionable.

As a journalist covering the industry, I've seen too many betting sites use aggressive branding to mask predatory practices. Logo B's minimal approach suggests they're not compensating for weak offerings with flashy design.

### Q3: Most modern and premium?

Logo B is objectively most modern. Clean, refined, contemporary.

But I question whether betting platforms should project "premium" - that's often code for "we'll take more of your money."

### Q4: Fits iGaming best?

Logo A fits traditional iGaming expectations - bold, shadowed, aggressive. That's exactly the problem.

Logo B breaks from predatory industry norms. If Yes Games wants to be responsible, they should look different from typical betting sites.

### Q5: Rankings

**1st: Logo B** - Least manipulative, most honest design
**2nd: Logo A** - Standard industry aesthetic, transparent about what it is
**3rd: Logo C** - Dangerous casualization of gambling

### Q6: What makes #1 better than #2?

Logo B shows restraint. Logo A uses visual weight (shadow) to create unearned authority.

In an industry that often exploits users, I trust brands that don't use every psychological trick available.
