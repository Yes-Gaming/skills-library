## Responses

### Q1: Winner?
Logo A! YES! The shadow gives it POWER! When my bet comes through during a match, I want that BOLD energy! Logo B is too quiet - where's the excitement?! Logo C is fun but the tilt is weird for quick reading during live matches.

### Q2: Trustworthy?
Logo B looks most professional, BUT Logo A feels trustworthy in a different way - it's CONFIDENT! Sports betting needs boldness!

### Q3: Modern/Premium?
Logo B is more "premium" but feels cold. Logo A has that sports energy - ESPN vibes! That's the premium I want!

### Q4: Fits iGaming best?
LOGO A! 100%! Bold, energetic, perfect for the rush of live betting! Logo B is too calm for sports!

### Q5: Rankings
1st: Logo A - ENERGY! Perfect for sports betting rush!
2nd: Logo B - Well-designed but too quiet for this category
3rd: Logo C - Fun but tilt is distracting

### Q6: #1 vs #2?
Logo A has PASSION! Logo B is beautiful but doesn't capture the emotion of sports betting! When Denmark scores and my bet hits - I need that BOLD YES energy!

**Winner:** Logo A (Bold "YES" with shadow) - Maximum sports betting energy!
