## Question 1: Clear Winner

**Q: Which of these three is your clear winner? Why?**

**A:** Logo 4. The shadow effect gives it weight and legitimacy. Looks established and professional. When I'm choosing where to put my money, I want something that looks solid, not flimsy. This one has that.

---

## Question 2: Most Trustworthy

**Q: Which feels most trustworthy?**

**A:** Logo 4 again. The depth makes it feel more substantial. Logo 2 is too light - almost looks temporary. Logo 1 with the tilt feels gimmicky. Trust comes from looking stable and reliable, and that shadow effect on Logo 4 delivers that.

---

## Question 3: Modern and Premium

**Q: Which feels most modern and premium?**

**A:** Logo 2 has the modern look, I'll give it that. Clean and minimal. But premium? Not really. Premium needs substance. Logo 4 balances both - modern enough but with depth that suggests quality.

---

## Question 4: iGaming/Betting Fit

**Q: Which fits iGaming/betting best?**

**A:** Logo 4. Betting needs to feel serious and secure. Logo 1 is too playful with that angle. Logo 2 feels more like a tech startup than a betting platform. Logo 4 has authority without being intimidating.

---

## Question 5: Final Ranking

**Q: Rank all 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning**

**A:**

**1st Place: Logo 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)**
- Most trustworthy appearance
- Shadow effect adds legitimacy and substance
- Professional without being corporate
- Makes me feel secure about using the platform

**2nd Place: Logo 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)**
- Modern and clean
- Works for younger crowd probably
- Too lightweight for my comfort
- Lacks the authority I want from a betting platform

**3rd Place: Logo 1 (Tilted stamp/sticker)**
- The angle bothers me
- Feels promotional rather than trustworthy
- Too casual for financial transactions
- Reminds me of temporary offers, not a stable platform

---

## Question 6: Winner vs Runner-up

**Q: What makes your #1 better than your #2?**

**A:** Substance. Logo 4 has visual weight that makes it feel established and reliable. Logo 2 looks nice but feels insubstantial - like it could disappear tomorrow. When I'm dealing with money, I want to see something solid. The shadow effect isn't just decoration, it communicates stability. Logo 2 is fine for an app that doesn't handle money, but for betting? I need more presence than that.

## Trust-Specific Observations

**Security Perception:**
- Logo 4 conveys the most security through its dimensional design
- Shadow creates sense of permanence and establishment
- Prefer visual indicators of stability when choosing gambling platforms

**Age-Appropriate Appeal:**
- Logo 2 may appeal to younger users but lacks gravitas for 40+ demographic
- Logo 4 bridges generations - modern enough, substantial enough
- Tilt in Logo 1 feels like trying too hard to be fun

**Decision Confidence:**
- Very clear preference for Logo 4
- Shadow effect is deciding factor
- Would feel more comfortable entering payment information with Logo 4
- Visual weight = business trustworthiness in my assessment
