## PHASE 2B: TOP 3 FINALISTS COMPARISON

**Context:** These are the top 3 logo finalists for Yes Games. Compare them carefully.

**Logos Presented (randomized order for this respondent):**

**Logo A:** Bold "YES" in tilted rectangular stamp/sticker style
**Logo B:** Bold "YES" with shadow effect
**Logo C:** Lowercase "yes" refined, clean, modern

## Test Responses

### Q1: Which of these three is your clear winner? Why?

Logo C.

Practically speaking, I need a logo that works across all the features without creating friction. Logo C is the most efficient choice. When I'm switching between sports betting during my lunch break and casino games in the evening, I don't have time for an app that feels fragmented. Logo C signals unified platform efficiency.

Logo A's tilt creates unnecessary visual complexity. Logo B's shadow doesn't add functional value. Logo C is clean, loads quickly visually, and works consistently. That's what matters.

### Q2: Which feels most trustworthy?

Logo C.

From a usability standpoint, trust comes from consistency. When a logo looks the same across all sections of an app - sports, casino, account management - it reinforces that everything is integrated and reliable. Logo C does this best.

Logo A's stamp angle makes it feel promotional, not permanent. Logo B's shadow creates rendering inconsistencies across different screens. Logo C is straightforward and dependable.

### Q3: Which feels most modern and premium?

Logo C.

Modern premium means efficient and functional, not decorated. Logo C has no unnecessary elements - every part serves a purpose. The lowercase is readable, the spacing is clean, it scales well across devices.

Logo B adds a shadow that doesn't improve function. Logo A adds a tilt that actually reduces efficiency (harder to read quickly). Logo C strips away anything that doesn't serve the user. That's premium functionality.

### Q4: Which fits iGaming/betting best?

Logo C fits best for a multi-product platform.

Does it work efficiently? Yes. Sports betting interface, casino games, live dealer, esports - Logo C functions well in all contexts without requiring the user to mentally adjust. That efficiency is what fits best.

Logo B might work for sports-only. Logo A might work for casino-only. But for everything in one app? Logo C is the practical choice.

### Q5: Rank all 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning

**1st Place: Logo C (Lowercase "yes" refined)**

Functional efficiency across all use cases:

**Cross-platform functionality:** I use Yes Games on my phone during commute (sports betting), on my iPad at home (casino games), occasionally on laptop (account management, bigger sports bets). Logo C works identically across all three devices. No rendering issues, no scale problems, no interface conflicts. That's efficient design.

**Context-switching efficiency:** My typical usage pattern: check sports odds (5 minutes), place a bet, switch to slots if I have time (10 minutes), check live scores, maybe place another bet. This requires fast context switching. Logo C doesn't create visual friction when switching contexts. Logo A's tilt and Logo B's shadow both create micro-delays in visual processing when your brain switches from sports interface to casino interface.

**Mental load reduction:** When I'm time-constrained (which is always), I need the app to reduce cognitive load, not add to it. Logo C is instantly recognizable, doesn't require processing decorative elements, just works. That's valuable.

**Practical integration:** One logo, one brand, one account, one wallet across all entertainment types. Logo C visually represents this practical integration better than alternatives.

**2nd Place: Logo B (Bold "YES" with shadow)**

Functional but suboptimal:

**What works:** Clear, bold, readable. The all-caps "YES" is straightforward.

**What doesn't work efficiently:**
- Shadow effect adds visual weight without adding functional value
- Different screen brightness settings make the shadow more or less visible - creates inconsistency
- When I'm using the app in bright sunlight (sports betting on the go), the shadow reduces contrast and readability
- The shadow is extra visual information my brain has to process - slows down recognition by milliseconds, which compounds over dozens of daily interactions

It's usable, but Logo C is more efficient.

**3rd Place: Logo A (Bold "YES" tilted stamp)**

Creates functional friction:

**Efficiency problems:**
- The tilt makes it harder to read quickly - my eyes have to adjust to the angle
- Doesn't align with standard UI patterns (navigation bars, headers are horizontal) - creates visual conflict
- The stamp frame takes up more space - less efficient use of screen real estate
- When the logo appears at small sizes (app icon, notifications), the tilt makes it harder to recognize quickly

**Practical issues:**
- Switching between sports and casino, the stamp aesthetic feels too casino-specific - creates expectation mismatch for sports betting
- The rectangular frame around "YES" adds a visual boundary that separates the logo from the interface rather than integrating it

It has personality, but personality that reduces efficiency isn't valuable for a tool I use for quick transactions.

### Q6: What makes your #1 better than your #2?

Logo C is more efficient than Logo B in practical, measurable ways.

**Speed of recognition:** I did an informal test with both logos. Logo C: instantly recognizable, brain processes it in probably 100-200 milliseconds. Logo B with shadow: takes slightly longer because my brain has to process the main text AND the shadow element - maybe 250-300 milliseconds. That 50-100ms difference doesn't sound like much, but I interact with the logo dozens of times per session across multiple sessions per week. That compounds.

**Consistency across usage contexts:** Here's a practical scenario: I'm betting on a football match on my phone while walking to a meeting (outdoor lighting, bright screen). Logo C is clear. Logo B's shadow creates contrast issues in bright light - the shadow blends with the text slightly, reducing readability. Later, I'm playing casino games at home in the evening (dim lighting, lower screen brightness). Logo C still clear. Logo B's shadow now appears more pronounced, changing the visual weight of the logo. These inconsistencies create friction.

**Interface integration efficiency:** In the app navigation bar, Logo C sits cleanly next to menu items and icons. Logo B's shadow creates visual weight imbalance - it feels heavier than surrounding UI elements, which draws attention unnecessarily. When I'm trying to quickly navigate to account settings or switch between sports and casino, I don't want the logo competing for attention. Logo C integrates efficiently. Logo B intrudes.

**Mental energy conservation:** Project management teaches you to conserve decision energy for things that matter. Every decorative element (like Logo B's shadow) requires micro-decisions from your brain: "What does that shadow mean? Is it important? Do I need to pay attention to it?" The answer is no, but your brain still processes it. Logo C doesn't create these micro-decisions. It's pure signal, no noise.

Functionally, Logo C is the more efficient choice. It does exactly what a unified platform logo should do - provide consistent brand presence across all features without creating friction, using minimal visual resources, supporting rather than competing with the functional interface.

Logo B works, but it's not optimized. And when you're using an app for quick entertainment during limited free time, optimization matters.
