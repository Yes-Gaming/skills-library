## Test Responses

### Q1: Which of these three is your clear winner? Why?

Logo A, and everyone I've shown it to agrees.

My friend group is super into unified platforms - we're always sharing bet slips across sports, casino, everything. Logo A is the kind of logo that works when you screenshot your wins and share them on Instagram Stories or in our group chat. It looks clean, modern, doesn't clash with the interface, and people recognize it as a real platform brand.

Logo B and C look more traditional gambling, which some of my friends say feels "old school" or "their dad's betting site." Logo A feels like a platform our generation would use and talk about.

### Q2: Which feels most trustworthy?

Logo A, based on what people are saying about platform brands.

Everyone's talking about how the best platforms now look like tech companies, not gambling sites. Logo A has that tech platform vibe - clean, professional, trustworthy like Spotify or Revolut. When you're in a friend group that shares betting tips and experiences, you want to be on a platform that feels legitimate.

My friends who use multiple gambling apps say the ones with cleaner, simpler branding usually have better experiences and fewer issues. Logo A gives that signal.

### Q3: Which feels most modern and premium?

Logo A is what people consider modern premium right now.

I work in social media, so I see what brands are trending and what design language resonates with our demographic. Lowercase, clean, minimal - that's what premium looks like in 2025. The gambling platforms getting the most social media engagement are the ones that look like entertainment platforms, not casinos.

Logo B and C look more like traditional betting sites. That might work for an older demographic, but my friend group and the people I see engaging with gambling content on socials prefer the modern aesthetic Logo A represents.

### Q4: Which fits iGaming/betting best?

Logo A fits modern social iGaming best.

When my friends and I are using these platforms, we're not just betting - we're sharing bet slips, comparing wins, talking about strategies in our group chats. The platforms that work best for this social experience are the ones that feel like unified entertainment hubs, not traditional gambling sites.

Logo A fits that social, integrated experience. Logo B feels more sports-betting-only. Logo C feels more casino-heavy. For a platform where you can bet on football with friends during the match, then play some slots during halftime, then share your wins - Logo A works better for that social use case.

### Q5: Rank all 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning

**1st Place: Logo A (Lowercase "yes" refined)**

This is what our community is gravitating toward:

**Social shareability:** When I screenshot a big win or an interesting bet slip to share on Stories or in group chats, Logo A looks good in screenshots. It's not distracting, doesn't look dated, and people recognize it as a legit platform. My friends who use different gambling apps say Logo A looks like a platform they'd want to be associated with socially.

**Cross-platform social presence:** My friend group uses Yes Games across everything - sports betting during matches (social watching parties), casino games individually, esports betting for tournaments we follow. Logo A works across all these social contexts. When someone shares a sports bet win, then later shares a casino jackpot, same clean logo - builds brand recognition in our social circles.

**Influencer/content perspective:** People in my network who create gambling content say clean logos work better for content creation. Logo A would look good in TikToks, Instagram Reels, YouTube thumbnails. Logo B and C are harder to integrate into content aesthetically.

**Community perception:** Everyone I've talked to about unified platforms says they prefer brands that look like "entertainment platforms" not "gambling sites." Logo A has that modern entertainment platform look that resonates socially.

**2nd Place: Logo B (Bold "YES" with shadow)**

This one's okay but less social-media-friendly:

**What works:** Bold and clear, stands out in some contexts.

**Social concerns:**
- Friends say the shadow effect looks "2015 design" - not what's trending now
- In screenshots and shared content, the shadow can look muddy or weird depending on background
- Feels more sports-betting-specific, which limits social versatility
- When people share this logo in group chats or on socials, it doesn't have the same modern appeal as Logo A

**Community feedback:** My friend group is split on Logo B. Some like the boldness for sports betting, others think it looks dated. That split perception isn't ideal for social sharing and word-of-mouth.

**3rd Place: Logo C (Bold "YES" tilted stamp)**

Social media and community issues:

**Social sharing problems:**
- The tilt makes it awkward in screenshots - doesn't frame well for vertical content (Stories, Reels)
- Looks very casino-specific, which limits social versatility
- Friends say it reminds them of promotional stickers, not a platform brand
- When shared in group chats, people comment on the tilt being "weird" or "trying too hard"

**Community perception:**
- My network sees this as "old gambling aesthetic"
- Doesn't fit the modern platform vibe people are talking about
- Hard to integrate into social content creation

It has personality, but my friends say that personality feels forced. Not what's resonating socially right now.

### Q6: What makes your #1 better than your #2?

Logo A is better than Logo B for social and community reasons:

**Social media compatibility:** I tested this by showing both logos to my friend group chat (8 people, all use gambling apps). For Logo A, everyone said "clean," "modern," "would use." For Logo B, responses were mixed: "okay," "bit much with the shadow," "looks older." In social/community contexts, consensus matters. Logo A builds positive consensus, Logo B creates split opinions.

**Content sharing experience:** My friends and I constantly share betting content - bet slips, wins, funny losses, strategy discussions. When you screenshot your sports bet with Logo A in the corner, it looks clean and professional. With Logo B, that shadow effect sometimes creates visual clutter in screenshots, especially if the interface behind it is already busy with odds, stats, etc.

**Cross-product social versatility:** Here's a real scenario from my friend group: Someone shares a Champions League bet slip (sports betting), then later shares a slots win (casino), then maybe an esports tournament bet. With Logo A, all three shares look cohesive - same clean logo, builds platform brand recognition in our social circle. With Logo B, the bold shadow effect feels right for the sports bet but looks heavy/weird for the casual slots win. That inconsistency dilutes social brand building.

**Platform perception in social circles:** Everyone's talking about how the best platforms now are "unified entertainment" not "gambling sites." Logo A signals that modern platform positioning. When I tell friends "I use Yes Games," I want them to think "oh cool, modern platform" not "oh, a betting site." Logo A enables the first reaction. Logo B, with its more traditional gambling aesthetic, triggers the second.

**Influencer/creator perspective:** People in my network who create content around gambling (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube) say they prefer working with platforms that have clean, modern branding. Logo A is easier to integrate into content, looks better in thumbnails, and doesn't date the content. Logo B's shadow effect is a design element that content creators have to work around, which makes it less appealing for partnerships and organic social promotion.

**Word-of-mouth effect:** When platforms have really clean, modern branding, people talk about them more positively. "Have you tried Yes Games? It's really clean and has everything" sounds better than "Have you tried that betting site with the shadow logo?" Logo A creates better word-of-mouth narrative.

From a social media and community perspective, Logo A is the clear winner. It builds better brand perception, works better for content sharing, creates positive consensus in friend groups, and aligns with how our demographic talks about and shares entertainment platforms.

Logo B is acceptable, but in social contexts where perception and shareability matter, Logo A performs significantly better.
