## Test Responses

### Q1: Which of these three is your clear winner? Why?

I think... maybe Logo B? I'm not completely sure, but it seems less overwhelming.

I guess when you're using an app for different things - maybe sports betting sometimes, casino games other times - having a logo that's simple and clean might make it feel less complicated? Logo B feels easier to understand. Logo A with the tilt is a bit confusing to look at, and Logo C with the shadow seems like it's trying to be exciting but maybe too much?

Not certain, but Logo B seems like it wouldn't make the app feel more complicated than it already is.

### Q2: Which feels most trustworthy?

Maybe Logo B? Though I'm not sure I can really tell trustworthiness from a logo...

I guess the simple, clean one looks more professional? Like it's not trying to trick you with fancy effects or tilted angles? Logo C's shadow makes me a bit uncertain - why does it need a shadow? Is that hiding something? And Logo A tilted makes me wonder if it's just a promotional thing, not a real permanent platform.

Logo B looks straightforward, I think. Could be more trustworthy because it's not trying too hard. But I'm not confident in that assessment.

### Q3: Which feels most modern and premium?

I think Logo B might be more modern? Maybe?

I'm not great at design trends, but the lowercase simple look seems like what newer apps use? Logo C with the shadow feels like older app design - though I could be wrong. Logo A's tilt is either very modern or very old-fashioned, I honestly can't tell which.

Premium is hard... Logo B looks expensive in a quiet way? Like it doesn't need to prove it's premium? But maybe that's not premium, maybe premium should be more obvious like Logo C's shadow?

Not sure. Probably Logo B but I'm uncertain.

### Q4: Which fits iGaming/betting best?

This is confusing because I don't know what iGaming "should" look like...

Logo C and Logo A look more like what I imagine gambling sites look like - bold, attention-grabbing. So maybe they fit better? But Logo B looks like it could be for lots of entertainment types, not just gambling specifically. And since the platform has sports and casino and other things, maybe fitting "gambling" specifically isn't the point?

I guess Logo B fits a unified platform better, even if it doesn't scream "gambling." Though I'm not confident that's the right answer.

### Q5: Rank all 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning

**1st Place: Logo B (Lowercase "yes" refined)**

I think this is my choice, though I'm not 100% certain.

**Why maybe Logo B:**
- Seems simpler, which is good when I'm already uncertain about using gambling apps
- Doesn't look overwhelming - just clean and easy
- Could work for sports betting when I try that, or casino games when I want something different
- Looks like a real company, not a sketchy gambling site (I worry about that)
- The lowercase "yes" feels friendly? Like it's saying "yes" to me trying different things without pressure
- Not sure if this matters, but it doesn't give me anxiety like the more aggressive designs

**My concerns:**
- Maybe it's too simple? Like maybe gambling sites should look more exciting?
- Not certain if "friendly" is what you want or if "powerful" (like Logo C) is better
- Could be boring compared to the others?

I'm choosing it but not with complete confidence. It just feels less intimidating for someone who's not sure about using these platforms regularly.

**2nd Place: Logo C (Bold "YES" with shadow)**

Maybe this should be second? I'm uncertain.

**What might be good:**
- Bold and clear, easy to see
- The shadow gives it some... dimension? Is that the word?
- Looks more like a gambling site, which could be reassuring in a "this is what it's supposed to be" way

**What makes me uncertain:**
- The shadow feels aggressive somehow? Like it's shouting "YES" at me
- Not sure if that boldness makes it trustworthy or untrustworthy
- Might work better for sports betting than casino games, so maybe not great for unified platform?
- Could be too much when I'm just casually trying some slots

It's okay but I'm not confident it's better than Logo B.

**3rd Place: Logo A (Bold "YES" tilted stamp)**

I think this is third, but I could be wrong.

**Concerns:**
- The tilt confuses me - why is it tilted? What does that mean?
- Makes me feel like it's a temporary promotion, not a real platform I'd trust long-term
- Harder to read quickly because of the angle
- Very casino-looking, which makes me worry it's too focused on one thing
- When I imagine switching between sports betting and casino games, this logo feels too specific to one side

**What might be good:**
- It's memorable, stands out
- Has personality

But the tilt makes me uncertain and a bit uncomfortable, so I'm putting it third. Though maybe some people like that distinctive look more than I do.

### Q6: What makes your #1 better than your #2?

I think Logo B is better than Logo C because it's less... intimidating? I'm not certain that's the right word.

Here's what I mean, I guess: When I'm using a platform for different entertainment types - maybe placing a small bet on a football match, maybe trying some casino games - I don't want to feel pressured or overwhelmed. Logo C with its bold "YES" and shadow effect feels like it's pushing me. Like it's saying "YES! DO IT! BET NOW!" That makes me anxious.

Logo B's lowercase "yes" feels more like... permission? Like it's saying "yes, you can try this" or "yes, it's okay to explore different games" without being aggressive about it. That's better for someone like me who's not confident or certain about gambling regularly.

Also, maybe this doesn't make sense, but Logo C's shadow makes the whole thing feel heavier somehow. When I imagine seeing that logo while I'm switching between sports betting and casino games, it feels like too much visual weight. Like the app is taking itself very seriously. Logo B is lighter, easier, doesn't make me feel like I need to be an expert or serious gambler to use it.

For a unified platform where I might just casually try different things without being sure what I'm doing, Logo B feels safer and less demanding. Logo C feels like it expects me to be confident and decisive, which I'm not.

Though I could be completely wrong about all of this. This is just how they make me feel, but maybe other people want that bold confident energy that Logo C has. I'm not sure.
