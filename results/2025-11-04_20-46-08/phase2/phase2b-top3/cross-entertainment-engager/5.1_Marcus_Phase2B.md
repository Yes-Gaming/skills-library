## Test Responses

### Q1: Which of these three is your clear winner? Why?

Logo C.

Works across all platforms. Sports, casino, esports - looks unified everywhere.

### Q2: Which feels most trustworthy?

Logo C.

Professional. Clean. Looks like a real platform brand.

### Q3: Which feels most modern and premium?

Logo C.

Modern design. Premium without being too loud.

### Q4: Which fits iGaming/betting best?

Logo B.

The stamp feel fits gambling better. But C works better for unified platform.

### Q5: Rank all 3 (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning

**1st Place: Logo C (Lowercase "yes" refined)**
Best for all-in-one platform. Works on sports betting interface, casino games, esports section. Consistent brand across everything. That's what matters for unified experience.

**2nd Place: Logo A (Bold "YES" with shadow)**
Decent. Shadow adds dimension. Could work across products but feels more casino-heavy.

**3rd Place: Logo B (Bold "YES" tilted stamp)**
Too specific. Works for one thing but not everything. Unified platform needs versatile logo.

### Q6: What makes your #1 better than your #2?

Logo C is more versatile. Logo A's shadow effect feels casino-centric. When I'm switching between sports bets, slot games, and esports tournaments in the same app, I need a logo that works for all of them. C does that. A feels too weighted toward one vertical.
