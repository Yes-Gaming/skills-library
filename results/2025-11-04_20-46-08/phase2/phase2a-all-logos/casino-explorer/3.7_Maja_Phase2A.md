## Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

Logo 2. Practically speaking, it's the most functional. Clean, easy to read, no unnecessary elements. When you're on a 15-minute break, you don't have time to decode complicated branding - you need something straightforward. This logo tells you what it is immediately without making you work for it.

---

## Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2. From a usability standpoint, trust comes from clarity and professionalism. This logo is clear about what it is - no tricks, no gimmicks. When I'm putting money into something during my lunch break, I need to trust it quickly. This logo communicates reliability efficiently.

---

## Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Logo 4. Is it easy to spot? Yes. The shadow makes it pop visually. Functionally speaking, if I'm scrolling through apps quickly (which I do because I don't have much time), this one would catch my eye first. It's practical for visibility.

---

## Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Logo 6. How quickly does it communicate "easy"? Immediately. The rounded, flowing letterforms literally look easy and smooth. From a practical standpoint, it matches the message functionally - if your promise is ease, your branding should look effortless, which this does.

---

## Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Logo 2. Practically speaking, when I have 15 minutes of break time, I need something that looks reliable and won't waste my time. This logo signals efficiency and quality. Does it work? Will it be straightforward? The clean design suggests yes to both. I'd download this because it looks like it won't complicate my limited free time.

---

## Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

1. **Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)** - Most functional. Easy to read, professional, clear. Is it easy to use? Everything about this suggests yes. From a usability standpoint, this scores highest on efficiency and clarity. It won't slow me down.

2. **Logo 6 (Rounded script)** - Practically speaking, the friendly approach is useful. The rounded forms make it approachable, which functionally means lower barrier to entry. How quickly can I start playing? This design suggests very quickly - it's inviting and uncomplicated.

3. **Logo 4 (Bold shadow)** - Functional for visibility. Does it catch attention? Yes. While it's not as clean as Logo 2, it serves a practical purpose in standing out. For an app store where you need to be noticed in seconds, this works functionally.

---

## Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

Logo 1 (Tilted stamp) - Practically speaking, the tilted angle makes it harder to read quickly. I don't have time to tilt my head or parse complicated orientations. The distressed effect adds visual noise without functional benefit. Not efficient.

Logo 3 (Script) - Is it easy to read? No. The script style is harder to scan quickly, and on a 15-minute break, every second counts. Functionally inferior for readability.

Logo 7 (YS monogram) - From a usability standpoint, I'd need to already know what YS means. How quickly does it communicate what the app is? It doesn't. Inefficient branding for quick recognition.

Logo 5 (Bold outline) - Too heavy. Practically speaking, the thick outline makes it feel cluttered rather than clear. It's trying to be bold but functionally it just adds visual weight without improving clarity or usability.
