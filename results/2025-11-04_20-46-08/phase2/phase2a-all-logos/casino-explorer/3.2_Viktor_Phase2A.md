## Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

Logo 2. Well, I think the reason is that it demonstrates excellent typographic hierarchy and clean execution. The refined lowercase treatment shows attention to detail - the kerning is balanced, the proportions are professional, and it avoids the common pitfall of over-designing. From a game developer's perspective, this would scale beautifully across different screen sizes and resolutions, which is critical for modern casino games. The simplicity doesn't mean it's boring; it means the designer understood restraint and let the letterforms do the work. This is the kind of logo that would look sharp on a loading screen, app icon, or promotional material without losing clarity.

---

## Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2. The refined, professional typography communicates legitimacy. When you look at established gaming platforms, they tend toward clean, confident branding rather than gimmicky effects. The lowercase treatment is approachable without sacrificing authority, which is exactly what you want for building trust in a gambling environment where users are literally putting money on the line.

---

## Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Logo 4. From a technical standpoint, the bold shadow treatment creates strong contrast and depth that would catch the eye in a crowded app store grid. The shadow effect adds dimensional interest that reads well even at small sizes, which is crucial because app icons are often viewed at 60x60 pixels or smaller. However, I'd be concerned about how this scales - the shadow might become muddy at very small sizes or on lower-resolution displays.

---

## Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Logo 6. The rounded script conveys ease and flow, which aligns with the "made easy" promise. The curve of the letterforms suggests smoothness and accessibility. From a UX perspective, rounded forms are psychologically associated with friendliness and approachability - there's actual research on this. The script style maintains visual interest while still being legible, which is important because "easy" doesn't mean "boring."

---

## Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Logo 2. Because when you analyze app store conversion, professional presentation builds initial trust, which is the first hurdle for downloads. A clean, refined logo signals quality curation of games and reliable platform performance. As someone who builds games, I know that the logo is essentially a promise about the experience quality. Logo 2 promises a polished, well-designed experience, which would make me more likely to invest time in trying it.

## Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

1. **Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)** - Superior technical execution. The typography is professional-grade, the spacing is precise, and it demonstrates design maturity. This would work across all touchpoints from mobile to desktop to marketing materials. The simplicity is a strength, not a weakness - it's memorable and scalable.

2. **Logo 4 (Bold shadow)** - Strong visual impact with good contrast. The dimensional treatment adds excitement without being chaotic. My concern is technical scalability and potential dated-ness over time, but for immediate visual appeal, it works well. The boldness aligns with casino excitement.

3. **Logo 6 (Rounded script)** - Good balance of personality and readability. The rounded treatment is psychologically effective for conveying "ease" and approachability. It has character without sacrificing legibility, though I'd want to test how it renders at very small sizes on mobile devices.

---

## Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

Logo 1 (Tilted stamp) - The tilted angle creates alignment challenges across UI elements and the distressed effect feels forced. From a technical perspective, that texture won't scale consistently across different rendering engines.

Logo 3 (Script) - The execution feels amateurish. The letterforms lack refinement and the script style is too loose for professional gaming branding. It would be difficult to maintain consistency across different applications.

Logo 7 (YS monogram) - Too minimal and lacks distinctiveness. Monograms work for established luxury brands but for a gaming platform, you need immediate name recognition. This would fail the app store visibility test because users wouldn't know what "YS" means without prior brand knowledge.

Logo 5 (Bold outline) - The outline treatment feels dated and the boldness crosses from confident into heavy-handed. The technical execution is fine, but the design direction feels like it's trying too hard to look "gaming" in a way that actually undermines sophistication.
