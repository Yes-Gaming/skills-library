## Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

LOGO 4! This is FIRE! The shadow effect is absolutely sick - it's got that dimensional pop that just HITS different! Love how bold it is, like it's not afraid to take up space and demand attention. This is the kind of branding that screams EXCITEMENT and BIG WINS! The visual impact is insane, would look amazing on stream overlays!

---

## Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2 probably? It's got that clean, professional vibe that says "we're legit." Not the most exciting one, but when you're putting money on the line you want something that looks established and reliable. It's like the difference between a flashy new game and a proven platform - this looks proven.

---

## Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Logo 4 NO QUESTION! That shadow treatment is EPIC for visibility! It would absolutely POP in an app store grid or in an ad. When I'm scrolling through my phone looking for new games, this would 100% catch my eye first. The boldness and depth just HIT different - it's got that "click me now" energy!

---

## Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Logo 6! The rounded, flowing script has that smooth, effortless vibe that matches "easy" perfectly. It's like butter - smooth, welcoming, not intimidating. You look at it and think "yeah, I could just jump in and start playing without any stress." The curve of the letters literally guides your eye like a smooth gameplay experience!

---

## Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Logo 4 for SURE! When I'm browsing the app store, I want something that looks EXCITING and promises a good time. That shadow effect and bold design screams "THIS APP IS GONNA BE LIT!" If I'm choosing between apps I don't know, I'm going with the one that looks like it'll deliver the most exciting experience. This one promises THRILLS!

## Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

1. **Logo 4 (Bold shadow)** - ABSOLUTE BANGER! The visual impact is INSANE! That shadow creates so much depth and excitement. This is the kind of logo that would look sick on my stream, in TikTok videos, on promotional banners. It's got ENERGY and POWER! Love it!

2. **Logo 5 (Bold outline)** - Also really solid! The bold outline treatment is strong and confident. It's got that "LETS GO!" energy. Maybe not as dimensional as Logo 4 but still really eye-catching and would look great in gaming content.

3. **Logo 6 (Rounded script)** - This one's got good vibes! The smooth, flowing style is welcoming and fun. It's not as HYPE as the bold ones but it's got personality and would work well for more chill, casual gaming moments. Still cool!

## Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

Logo 7 (YS monogram) - Too boring! Where's the excitement?! It's just letters, no personality, no ENERGY! This would be dead content for streaming - nothing to get hyped about.

Logo 2 (Refined lowercase) - Clean but kinda bland? Like it's professional which is fine, but where's the EXCITEMENT?! Gaming should be thrilling and this is just... there. No wow factor.

Logo 1 (Tilted stamp) - Looks dated, like something from before I was born lol. The vintage distressed thing doesn't hit with my generation - we want clean, modern, SHARP graphics not something that looks old.

Logo 3 (Script) - Weak execution. The script style could be cool but this specific one just doesn't deliver. Looks amateurish and wouldn't pop in content at all.
