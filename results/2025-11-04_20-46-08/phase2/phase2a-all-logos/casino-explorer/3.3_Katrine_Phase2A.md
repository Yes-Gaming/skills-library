## Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

Logo 2, I guess. This seems designed to look professional without being manipulative. It doesn't try to create artificial excitement or use visual tricks to catch your attention. I'm suspicious of logos that work too hard to look "fun" or "exciting" because that's usually masking predatory practices.

---

## Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2. It's the only one that doesn't feel like it's trying to manipulate me. The others all have some psychological angle - shadows for depth perception, rounded edges for comfort, distressed effects for authenticity. Logo 2 is just... straightforward typography. Which makes me trust it more because it's not playing psychological games.

---

## Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Logo 4 would definitely stand out, but that's exactly the problem. This seems designed to exploit attention-grabbing mechanisms. The shadow creates dimensional depth that our brains are wired to notice, and the boldness triggers arousal responses. It's effective, but it feels manipulative - like it's designed to bypass rational decision-making and trigger impulsive downloads.

---

## Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Logo 6, maybe. The rounded script does communicate "ease" through soft edges and flowing forms. From a psychology perspective, rounded shapes are associated with safety and comfort. But I'm skeptical - is this genuinely about making things easy, or is it using design psychology to make gambling feel safer than it actually is?

---

## Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Honestly? None of them inspire confidence when I know nothing about the app. But if I had to choose, Logo 2. Because it's the least manipulative. It doesn't promise excitement it can't deliver, doesn't use visual tricks to create false trust, and doesn't try to make gambling look "fun" in a way that downplays the risks. I'd rather download something honest-looking than something designed to trigger my dopamine response.

## Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

1. **Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)** - Least manipulative design. Doesn't use psychological tricks. Professional without being flashy. If they're confident enough to use restrained branding, maybe they're not relying on addiction mechanics to keep users.

2. **Logo 7 (YS monogram)** - Minimal approach means less opportunity for manipulation. Though I'm suspicious that minimalism might be its own form of manipulation - luxury branding to make gambling feel premium and exclusive.

3. **Logo 6 (Rounded script)** - The psychology is obvious (rounded = safe and friendly) but at least it's not aggressive. It's manipulative in a softer way, which I guess is marginally better than the in-your-face excitement tactics.

---

## Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

Logo 4 (Bold shadow) - This seems designed to trigger impulsive responses. The visual weight and contrast are calculated to grab attention and create excitement. From a psychology perspective, this is exactly the kind of branding that precedes predatory practices.

Logo 1 (Tilted stamp) - The distressed, vintage effect is trying to create false authenticity. It's a psychological trick to make something new seem established and trustworthy. I don't trust that.

Logo 5 (Bold outline) - Too aggressive. The heavy outline and bold treatment feel like they're compensating for something - probably lack of actual quality in the platform itself.

Logo 3 (Script) - Trying too hard to look fun and friendly. This seems designed to make gambling feel casual and harmless, which is a dangerous psychological manipulation for an activity that can be addictive.
