## Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

I guess... maybe Logo 2? I'm not really sure, but it seems like the safest choice? It's not too flashy or aggressive, which I appreciate because I'm already nervous about gambling. Logo 4 is kind of eye-catching but maybe too much? I think maybe the simple, clean one feels less intimidating, though I could be wrong...

---

## Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Probably Logo 2? I think maybe because it looks professional and not too... I don't know, not too much like it's trying to get me excited? When I'm worried about spending money, I guess I prefer something that looks serious and trustworthy. Though I'm not certain - maybe Logo 7 could also be trustworthy because it's minimal? I'm not sure...

---

## Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Logo 4, I suppose? The shadow makes it more noticeable, I think. Though I'm not sure if standing out is what I personally want - maybe something quieter would be better? But if I have to choose which one would catch my eye, probably Logo 4... though Logo 5 is also pretty bold. Maybe one of those two?

---

## Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

I guess Logo 6? The rounded letters look kind of... friendly? And easy, maybe? I'm not really sure what "Play Made Easy" should look like exactly, but the soft curves seem less intimidating than the bold ones. Could be Logo 2 also because simple might mean easy? I'm not certain which interpretation is right...

---

## Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

I think maybe... Logo 2? Because I'd be so nervous about trying a new gambling app, I'd want something that looks safe and reliable. The flashy ones like Logo 4 make me worry it might be trying to get me to spend too much. But I'm not sure - maybe that's overthinking it? Could be Logo 6 if friendly is better than professional? I guess Logo 2, but I'm not confident about this choice...

---

## Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

1. **Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)** - I guess this one because it seems the least risky? Professional but not intimidating, clean but not boring. Maybe. I think it wouldn't make me feel pressured or manipulated, which is important when I'm already uncertain about gambling.

2. **Logo 6 (Rounded script)** - Possibly this one because it looks friendly? The soft edges are less anxiety-inducing, I think. Though maybe that's actually a manipulation tactic to make me feel safe when I should be cautious? I'm not sure...

3. **Logo 7 (YS monogram)** - Maybe this one? It's minimal and simple, which could be good because it's not trying too hard. Though I'm not really sure what YS means, which makes me a bit uncertain. Could be Logo 4 instead because at least that's clear and confident, even if it's a bit much?

---

## Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

I think maybe Logo 5 (Bold outline)? It feels too aggressive and makes me nervous - like it's trying to pressure me. Though I'm not sure, maybe some people like that confidence?

Logo 3 (Script) - I guess this one because it looks... I don't know, unprofessional? Which worries me when money is involved. Though maybe I'm being too harsh?

Logo 1 (Tilted stamp) - Probably this one? The vintage look confuses me - is it old and outdated or intentionally retro? I'm not sure, and that uncertainty makes me uncomfortable. Though maybe that's a me problem?

Logo 4 (Bold shadow) - Wait, should I eliminate this? I said it stood out but maybe that's a problem? I'm worried it's too exciting and might encourage risky behavior. But I'm not certain - maybe excitement is okay? I don't know...
