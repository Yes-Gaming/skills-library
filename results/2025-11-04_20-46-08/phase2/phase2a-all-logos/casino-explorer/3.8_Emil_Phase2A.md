## Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

Logo 4! Everyone says that bold, high-contrast designs perform best on social media, and this one definitely has that Instagram-worthy quality. The shadow effect would look amazing in screenshots of big wins. I think most people would screenshot this and share it - it's got that shareable visual punch. My friends would definitely notice this one.

---

## Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2. People I know in the industry say that clean, professional branding builds credibility. This one has that established brand feel - like something that would have good reviews and social proof. Everyone says you can't go wrong with clean, minimal design for trust.

---

## Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Logo 4 no question. Trending analysis shows that designs with depth and dimension get more engagement on social platforms. This would definitely stand out in a feed or app store grid. Everyone's talking about how important first impressions are, and this one makes an impression.

---

## Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Logo 6. I think most people would associate the rounded, friendly style with "easy" and approachable. It's got that soft, welcoming vibe that's trending right now - everyone's moving away from sharp, aggressive branding toward friendlier aesthetics. This fits that trend.

---

## Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Logo 4. Everyone says you have seconds to grab attention in the app store, and this one grabs it. My friends would be more likely to try something that looks exciting and visually interesting. The bold design suggests it's popular and worth checking out - like it's trending for a reason.

---

## Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

1. **Logo 4 (Bold shadow)** - Most shareable aesthetic. Everyone's talking about visual impact on social media, and this has it. The shadow effect would look great in Instagram stories or TikTok videos of big wins. People I follow would definitely use this.

2. **Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)** - Social proof suggests minimal design is trusted. Everyone says clean branding performs well for credibility. My network would respect this choice - it's what successful apps use.

3. **Logo 6 (Rounded script)** - Trending toward friendly design. People I know in design say rounded, approachable branding is what's popular now. It's got that contemporary, welcoming feel that performs well socially.

---

## Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

Logo 7 (YS monogram) - People I know say minimalist monograms don't work on social media because they're not distinctive or shareable. Everyone skips over generic minimal logos. No viral potential.

Logo 3 (Script) - My friends in design all say this style looks amateur. Everyone's moving toward either clean modern or bold impactful - this wishy-washy script doesn't fit current trends at all.

Logo 1 (Tilted stamp) - Trending analysis shows vintage/distressed effects are declining. People my age associate this with outdated branding. Everyone says it looks like it's trying too hard to be retro.

Logo 5 (Bold outline) - Everyone says there's a fine line between bold and heavy, and this crosses it. People I follow would see this as trying too hard. The outline treatment feels a bit dated compared to current design trends.
