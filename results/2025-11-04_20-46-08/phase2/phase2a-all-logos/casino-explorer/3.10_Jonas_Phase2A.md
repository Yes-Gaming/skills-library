## Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

Logo 2. Obviously. It's the only one here that meets premium standards. Clean, refined, professional execution - this is what high-quality platforms use. The typography is sophisticated, the design is confident without being desperate for attention. When you're at my level, you recognize quality immediately, and Logo 2 clearly delivers it. The others are trying too hard or not trying enough.

---

## Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2. No question. Premium platforms don't need flashy gimmicks to build trust - they use refined, professional branding that signals competence and reliability. This is clearly the work of serious designers and a serious company. The minimalist approach shows confidence - they don't need effects or tricks because they know they're offering quality. Definitely the most trustworthy option here.

---

## Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Logo 4. Clearly. The dimensional shadow treatment creates maximum visual impact. For pure attention-grabbing, this wins. However, standing out isn't everything - you also need to attract the right clientele. Logo 4 stands out but might attract casual players rather than premium users. But if the question is purely about visibility, Logo 4 is obviously the answer.

---

## Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Logo 2. "Easy" doesn't mean casual or soft - it means effortless sophistication. Logo 2 represents the kind of seamless, premium experience where everything just works perfectly without friction. The clean design is the visual equivalent of a frictionless user experience. Clearly the best representation of ease at a premium level.

---

## Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Logo 2. Absolutely. When I evaluate new platforms, I look for signals of quality and professionalism. Logo 2 signals that this is a serious operation with high standards - exactly what I need for significant stakes. The refined branding tells me they've invested in quality across the board, from design to gaming experience to customer service. Obviously the best choice for someone who values premium quality.

## Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

1. **Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)** - Clearly the best. Premium execution, sophisticated design, professional polish. This is what top-tier platforms look like. The restraint and refinement signal quality and confidence. When you're dealing with substantial amounts, you want a platform that looks like this - serious, professional, premium.

2. **Logo 4 (Bold shadow)** - Strong visual impact. While not as refined as Logo 2, it has presence and boldness that works for casino excitement. The dimensional effect creates engagement. It's a bit mass-market for my taste, but I can appreciate the execution. Second place, definitely.

3. **Logo 7 (YS monogram)** - The minimal approach has merit for premium branding. Monograms can signal exclusivity and sophistication. However, this execution is too bare - it needs more refinement to truly compete at the premium level. It has potential but doesn't quite deliver. Third place by default because everything else is clearly inferior.

---

## Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

Logo 3 (Script) - Obviously amateur work. The execution is weak, the style is unsophisticated. This screams low-budget operation. No question about eliminating this.

Logo 1 (Tilted stamp) - The distressed vintage effect is trying too hard to create artificial authenticity. Premium brands don't need gimmicks like this. The tilted angle is unprofessional. Clearly doesn't meet standards.

Logo 5 (Bold outline) - Too heavy-handed. The thick outline is unsophisticated and feels cheap rather than bold. This is what you get when designers confuse aggression with confidence. Definitely eliminate.

Logo 6 (Rounded script) - Too casual and soft for serious gambling. This might work for a children's app but not for a premium casino platform. The friendly approach undermines the sophisticated experience I demand. Clearly wrong positioning.
