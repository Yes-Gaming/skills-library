## Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

Logo 1. So there was this time I was in Barcelona, and I stumbled upon this old casino in a historic building. The architecture had this amazing vintage character - faded grandeur, stories in every detail. Logo 1 reminds me of that experience. The tilted stamp with the distressed texture, it's like finding an old travel stamp in your passport that brings back memories. It tells a story of something established, something with history. The other logos are fine, but they don't have that narrative quality - they're just... there. This one has lived a life.

---

## Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2. It's like when I stayed at that boutique hotel in Copenhagen - nothing flashy, but everything was perfect. The refined, understated elegance spoke volumes about their confidence and quality. This logo has that same energy. It doesn't need to shout or add effects to prove itself. It's the kind of branding you'd see on a place that's been around, that knows what it's doing, that doesn't need gimmicks.

---

## Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Logo 4. This reminds me of those neon-lit casino strips in Vegas - couldn't miss them even if you tried. The bold shadow treatment has that same "LOOK AT ME" energy. When I was there documenting the strip for my blog, everything was competing for attention, and the places that used depth and shadow in their signage were the ones that caught your eye first. This logo has that quality - it jumps off the screen like those illuminated casino signs jump out at night.

---

## Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Logo 6. It's like the flow of a story that just carries you along effortlessly. I remember writing this piece about rafting in Norway - when you're in the right current, everything just flows, you don't have to fight it. The rounded script in Logo 6 has that same quality. The curves literally guide your eye like a river path, smooth and natural. "Play Made Easy" should feel like being carried by a good story - no resistance, just flow.

---

## Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Logo 1. When I'm traveling and discovering new places, I'm always drawn to things with character and story. I remember finding this hidden game café in Prague - the worn signage and vintage aesthetics promised an experience with soul, not just another generic tourist trap. Logo 1 has that same quality. The distressed stamp effect suggests there's a story here, a personality, something worth discovering. The other logos could be any app, but this one feels like it has history and character.

---

## Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

1. **Logo 1 (Tilted stamp)** - This reminds me of all the stamped visas in my passport - each one tells a story of an adventure. The distressed texture and tilted angle give it personality and history. It's not just a logo, it's a character. When I look at it, I imagine the stories behind it, the experiences it represents. Gaming should have that narrative quality.

2. **Logo 4 (Bold shadow)** - It's like when I photographed those dramatic cliff formations in Norway - the shadows created depth and drama that made the landscape feel alive. This logo uses shadow the same way - to create dimension and excitement. It promises a visual experience with depth, which aligns with my love for visually rich, thematic games.

3. **Logo 6 (Rounded script)** - This is like the flowing canals in Amsterdam that I featured in my travel series - there's a pleasant rhythm and ease to the way the curves move. The storytelling element here is about journey and flow. It suggests an experience that will carry you along naturally, which is appealing for casual gaming.

## Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

Logo 7 (YS monogram) - It's like those generic corporate hotels you find in every airport - technically fine, but completely forgettable. No story, no character, no reason to remember it. When I write about travel experiences, I skip the places with no personality. This logo is that place.

Logo 3 (Script) - This reminds me of amateur travel blogs that try too hard to look artistic but miss the mark. The execution feels unfinished, like a rough draft that needed more work. There's no coherent story here, just an attempt at style without substance.

Logo 5 (Bold outline) - It's trying to be bold and strong, but it feels forced - like those tourist traps that put up huge signs because they have nothing authentic to offer. When something is genuinely good, it doesn't need to shout. This is shouting.

Logo 2 (Refined lowercase) - I actually like this one, but for elimination purposes - it's almost too minimal for storytelling. It's like a blank page. Professional and clean, yes, but where's the adventure? Where's the narrative hook? Gaming is about stories and experiences, and this is a bit too neutral.
