### Logo 5 (Bold outline)
**Overall Performance: Strong second place, acceptable alternative**

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Q1: Overall Preference | 0/10 winner | Never first choice |
| Q2: Trust Leader | 0/10 winner | Professional but secondary |

| Second Place | 7/10 (70%) | Most common 2nd choice |

## Cross-Cutting Trust Themes

### 1. Professional Appearance = Trust Proxy
**10/10 Trust Seekers agree:**
Professional design signals:
- Proper licensing (Jens, Hanne, Kirsten, Per)
- Strong security (Lars, Henrik)
- Responsible gambling tools (Hanne, Kirsten, Henrik)
- Corporate governance (Hanne, Søren, Per)
- Customer service quality (Søren, Birthe)

**Key Insight:** For Trust Seekers, visual professionalism is not aesthetic preference - it's predictive signal for operational quality.

---

### 2. Casual/Script = Immediate Red Flag
**10/10 Trust Seekers eliminated Logos 3 & 6:**

**Universal concerns:**
- Financial transactions require seriousness
- Casual appearance = casual security practices
- Party aesthetics inappropriate for gambling
- Scripts signal amateur operations
- Spoofing/readability vulnerabilities

**Pattern:** Casual design triggers deep mistrust across all trust frameworks (security, legal, financial, social).

---

### 3. Aggressive Design = Exploitation Signal
**10/10 Trust Seekers eliminated Logo 4:**

**Universal concerns:**
- Manipulative intentions suspected
- Dark pattern correlation
- Predatory business practices
- Just want my money (not customer protection)
- Marketing law violation risks

**Pattern:** Visual aggression interpreted as business aggression across all variants.

---

### 4. Gimmicks = Reliability Questions
**10/10 Trust Seekers eliminated Logo 1:**

**Universal concerns:**
- Unnecessary complications
- Visual instability = operational instability
- Trying too hard to be different
- Covering up quality issues
- Corporate governance red flags

**Pattern:** Gimmicky design makes Trust Seekers question what else might be "off."

---

### 5. Balance Matters: Professional + Approachable
**Logo 2's unique strength:**

Trust Seekers don't just want professional - they want professional WITH warmth:
- "Professional but not cold" (Jens, Kirsten)
- "Approachable but serious" (Hanne, Kirsten)
- "Modern but trustworthy" (Søren)
- "Straightforward and friendly" (Michael)
- "Refined and warm" (Kirsten)

**Key Insight:** Logo 2 uniquely achieves this balance. Logo 7 is professional but too cold. Logo 5 is clean but too marketing-forward. Logo 2 is the Goldilocks solution.

---

### 6. Trust = Multi-Stage Gatekeeping
**All Trust Seekers use progressive evaluation:**

1. **Visual Filter (Logo):** Does it look trustworthy enough to investigate?
2. **Research Phase:** If passed visual, check licensing/reviews
3. **Deep Verification:** Terms, security, responsible gambling tools
4. **Trial:** Small deposit test
5. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuous trust verification

**Logo's Role:** Not to create trust, but to ENABLE progression to verification stages.

**Logo 2's Performance:**
- Passes visual filter for 10/10 Trust Seekers
- Sets positive expectations for research phase
- Only logo that doesn't trigger elimination before investigation

**Logos 1, 3, 4, 6 Performance:**
- Eliminated at visual filter stage
- Never reach research phase
- Trust evaluation stops immediately

---

---

## Demographic Implications

- Hanne (Accountant): Systematic evaluation frameworks
- Michael (Electrician): Quality work = quality branding
- Lisbeth (HR): Reputation management lens

**Key Insight:** Trust Seekers apply professional expertise to logo evaluation. Logo 2 signals competence across all professional domains.

### Income & Value ($45K-85K DKK/month)

**High-Value Users Have High Standards:**
