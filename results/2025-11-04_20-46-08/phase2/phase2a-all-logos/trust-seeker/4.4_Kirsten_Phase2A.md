## Phase 2A Questions & Responses

### Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Kirsten's Response:**
"Oh, I really like Logo 2! It's clean and modern, but also looks trustworthy - and that's so important! I love the fun of gambling, but I also need to know that I'm on a safe platform. Logo 2 looks like a company that would have proper limits and responsible gambling tools. It's professional but not cold - there's something approachable about it. It says 'we're serious about keeping you safe while you have fun.' That's exactly what I need!"

**Key Themes:**
- Balance of fun and safety
- Trust essential despite enjoyment
- Professional = safety tools
- Approachable yet serious
- Responsible gambling priority

---

### Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Kirsten's Response:**
"Logo 2, absolutely! Trust is key when you're gambling - I need to know the site is licensed and has good responsible gambling practices. Logo 2 looks like a professional company that would have clear limits I can set, warnings when I'm spending too much, and proper Spillemyndigheden licensing visible.

Logo 6 and Logo 3 are pretty, but they look too casual - like they're more about fun than safety. That worries me because gambling should be fun, but SAFE fun! Logo 4 looks aggressive - makes me think they just want my money. Logo 1 is too gimmicky.

Logo 2 strikes the perfect balance - it looks professional enough to trust, but not so corporate that it feels cold. I'd trust them with my weekend entertainment budget because they look like they'd help me stay in control."

**Trust Elements Identified:**
- Licensing visibility expectations
- Responsible gambling tools
- Spending limits and warnings
- Professional = protective
- Balance of fun and safety
- Control support systems

**Red Flags:**
- Too casual = safety de-prioritized
- Aggressive = exploitative
- Gimmicky = untrustworthy

---

### Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Kirsten's Response:**
"Logo 4 would definitely catch my eye first - it's bold! But catching my eye and making me download are different things. Logo 4 might get me to look, but then I'd think 'is this a trustworthy site?' and probably keep scrolling.

Logo 2 would stand out in a good way - it looks professional and modern, so it would catch my attention among all the flashy gambling apps. It's like when I'm choosing educational apps for the kindergarten - the professional-looking ones stand out because they're different from all the overly colorful, chaotic ones.

I think Logo 2 would stand out to people like me who want fun but also care about safety. That's the right audience to stand out to!"

**Analysis:**
- Attention ≠ trust
- Professional contrast differentiates
- Target audience quality matters
- Comparison to professional selection process
- Right kind of standout important

---

### Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Kirsten's Response:**
"Logo 2 represents 'Play Made Easy' perfectly! Easy should mean:
- Easy to set my limits
- Easy to see responsible gambling tools
- Easy to understand the rules
- Easy to trust the platform

It shouldn't mean 'easy to lose control' or 'casually risky' - that's what worries me about Logo 3 and Logo 6. They make gambling look too casual and easy in a carefree way. Gambling is fun, but it's not carefree - it involves real money!

Logo 2 says 'we've made responsible gambling easy' - and that's what I need. I love my weekend games, but only if I can trust that the platform will help me stay in my budget and keep it fun. Logo 2 looks like it would do that!"

**"Easy" Interpreted As:**
- Easy to manage responsibly
- Easy to understand
- Easy to trust
- Easy to control

**Rejected Interpretation:**
- Easy = carefree/casual
- Easy = losing control

### Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Kirsten's Response:**
"Logo 2, definitely! Here's why: I love gambling for fun, but I'm also careful. When my colleague recommended her platform to me, the first thing she said was 'it's licensed and has good limits' - that's what made me try it.

If I saw Logo 2 in the app store, I'd think 'this looks professional and trustworthy, let me check if it has good responsible gambling features.' It looks like a company that would:
- Show Spillemyndigheden licensing clearly
- Have deposit limits I can set
- Send me notifications if I'm playing too much
- Have easy access to help if I need it

Logo 6 might look fun, but it doesn't give me confidence that they'd have those safety features. Logo 4 looks like they'd try to get me to spend more than I should. Logo 2 looks like they'd help me have fun safely - that's what would make me download!

Trust is key! I won't download something that doesn't look like it takes player safety seriously, no matter how fun it looks."

**Download Decision Factors:**
1. Professional appearance = safety features
2. Peer recommendation pattern (trusted colleague)
3. Responsible gambling tool expectations
4. Visual proxy for protective measures
5. Safety-first despite enjoyment motivation

**Safety Features Expected:**
- Visible licensing
- Deposit limits
- Usage notifications
- Help access

### Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and briefly explain your reasoning for each.

**Kirsten's Rankings:**

**1st Place: Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)**
"Love it! Perfect balance of professional and approachable. Looks trustworthy and fun at the same time. This is exactly what a responsible gambling platform should look like - serious about safety, but still friendly!"

**2nd Place: Logo 5 (Bold outline)**
"This one is nice too! Clean and modern. Looks trustworthy and professional. Not quite as warm as Logo 2, but still gives me confidence that they'd have good responsible gambling practices. Good second choice!"

**3rd Place: Logo 7 (YS monogram)**
"Professional and clean. Maybe a bit too simple - doesn't feel as friendly - but it looks trustworthy. I'd trust this logo, but Logo 2 feels more welcoming while still being safe."

**Ranking Pattern:**
- Trust essential in all three
- Warmth/approachability valued
- Professional appearance required
- Responsible gambling expectations
- Balance prioritized

### Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Kirsten's Response:**
"I'd eliminate four right away:

**Logo 3 and Logo 6 - Too casual!**
They're pretty, but they look too much like party invitations! Gambling is fun, yes, but it's also serious because it involves my money. These logos make it look too carefree and casual. I worry that a platform with these logos wouldn't take responsible gambling seriously. Where are the safety tools? Where's the professionalism? I need to see that they care about player protection, and these logos don't show that. Eliminated!

**Logo 4 - Too aggressive!**
This one makes me uncomfortable. The bold shadow feels pushy, like they're trying too hard to get my attention - and my money! It doesn't look like a platform that would help me set limits or warn me if I'm spending too much. It looks like they just want me to play more and more. That's not the kind of gambling environment I want. Trust is key, and this doesn't build trust! Eliminated!

**Logo 1 - Too gimmicky!**
The tilted stamp thing feels like a gimmick. Why is it tilted? It makes me question if other things about the platform are also 'off' or unreliable. I need straightforward, trustworthy platforms. Gimmicks make me nervous - if they're trying this hard to be different, what are they hiding? Eliminated!

Only Logo 2, 5, and 7 look like platforms that would have proper licensing and responsible gambling features. The others look fun, but not SAFE fun - and safety is non-negotiable for me!"

**Elimination Criteria:**
- Too casual = safety de-prioritized
- Aggressive = exploitative intent
- Gimmicky = unreliable
- Must demonstrate protection commitment
- Fun must be paired with safety
