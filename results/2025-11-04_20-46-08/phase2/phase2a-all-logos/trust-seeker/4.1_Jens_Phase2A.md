---

## Phase 2A Questions & Responses

### Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Jens' Response:**
"Logo 2. Clean, professional. No gimmicks. Looks like a real business that takes security seriously. I don't have time for flashy nonsense - I want something that looks legitimate."

**Key Themes:**
- Professional appearance
- Security signals
- Legitimacy
- No-nonsense design

---

### Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Jens' Response:**
"Logo 2, no question. It's straightforward. The others try too hard - Logo 3 and 6 look like party invitations, not a licensed gambling site. Logo 4 is too aggressive. Logo 2 says 'we're professional, we have licensing, your money is safe here.'"

**Trust Signals Identified:**
- Straightforward design = trustworthy
- Professional = licensed
- Not trying too hard
- Implicit security message

**Rejected Elements:**
- Party aesthetics (Scripts)
- Aggressive design (Bold shadow)
- Overly casual appearance

---

### Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Jens' Response:**
"Probably Logo 4 or Logo 1. They're bold. But standing out isn't everything if you look unprofessional. I'd notice Logo 4, but I wouldn't trust it. Logo 2 stands out in a better way - it looks premium and serious."

**Analysis:**
- Acknowledges visual hierarchy (bold = attention)
- But prioritizes trust over attention
- "Premium and serious" = his definition of positive standout

---

### Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Jens' Response:**
"Logo 2. Easy doesn't mean childish or casual - it means clear, simple, professional. When I see Logo 2, I think 'this platform will be straightforward, no hidden terms, easy to understand.' That's what 'easy' should mean for a gambling site."

**Interpretation of "Easy":**
- Clarity
- Simplicity
- Professional presentation
- Transparency implied
- NOT casual or playful

---

### Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Jens' Response:**
"Logo 2. I've been burned by shady gambling sites before - that's why I'm careful now. Logo 2 looks like it's properly licensed, has customer support, won't disappear with my money. The script ones look amateur. Logo 4 looks aggressive like they want to take my money fast. Logo 2 looks stable and trustworthy."

**Decision Factors:**
- Past negative experience drives caution
- Licensing perception critical
- Customer support implied
- Financial security paramount
- Stability signals

**Rejected:**
- Amateur appearance
- Aggressive monetization signals

---

### Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and briefly explain your reasoning for each.

**Jens' Rankings:**

**1st Place: Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)**
"Most professional, looks trustworthy, straightforward design. This is what a licensed gambling platform should look like."

**2nd Place: Logo 5 (Bold outline)**
"Clean, bold without being aggressive. Looks more modern than Logo 2, but maybe less serious. Good backup option."

**3rd Place: Logo 7 (YS monogram)**
"Simple and clean. Professional enough. Doesn't stand out much, but doesn't turn me off either. Safe choice."

**Analysis:**
- Trust and professionalism dominate all three choices
- Modern appreciated but secondary to trust
- Safety is valued (3rd choice rationale)
- No script/playful options in top 3

---

### Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Jens' Response:**
"Logo 3 and Logo 6 - gone immediately. They look like wedding invitations or party flyers, not gambling platforms. I need to see Spillemyndigheden licensing, not calligraphy. Logo 1 also out - the tilted stamp thing feels gimmicky, like they're trying to be 'different' instead of trustworthy. And Logo 4 - too aggressive, makes me think they're trying to manipulate people. Only Logo 2, 5, and 7 look legitimate enough for me to even consider."

**Eliminated:**
- **Logo 3 (Script)** - Too casual, party aesthetic
- **Logo 6 (Rounded script)** - Wedding invitation appearance
- **Logo 1 (Tilted stamp)** - Gimmicky, forced differentiation
- **Logo 4 (Bold shadow)** - Aggressive, manipulative perception

**Survivors:**
- Logo 2, 5, 7 (all clean, professional designs)
