## Phase 2A Questions & Responses

### Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Birthe's Response:**
"I like Logo 2 best. It reminds me of the kind of professional companies I used to recommend to parents when I was teaching - clear, trustworthy, straightforward. You know, my friend Anne had a terrible experience with an online gambling site a few years ago. The site had a very flashy logo, all sorts of fancy designs, and she thought it looked exciting. But then they made it impossible to withdraw her winnings, and their customer service never responded. She lost over 3,000 kroner.

After that happened, my sister and I became very careful about which sites we use. We look for ones that seem professional and trustworthy, not flashy and exciting. Logo 2 has that professional look - it doesn't try to dazzle you with fancy effects. It's straightforward and clear, like a company that has nothing to hide. That's what I need at my age. I want to enjoy my bingo and slots, but I need to know the company is legitimate and won't disappear with my money."

**Key Themes:**
- Personal story driving caution
- Friend's negative experience influential
- Professional = trustworthy
- Anti-flashy preference
- Age-appropriate skepticism
- Transparency signals

### Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Birthe's Response:**
"Definitely Logo 2. This reminds me of when I had to choose between different educational software providers for the kindergarten. The companies with simple, clear logos were always the most reliable ones - good customer service, transparent pricing, no hidden surprises. The ones with fancy, complicated logos often had problems.

Logo 2 looks like a company that would show their Spillemyndigheden license clearly on their website, have real customer service people you can call, and actually process your withdrawals when you ask. It's professional without being cold.

I don't trust Logo 3 or Logo 6 - those script ones remind me of the site that scammed Anne. They look too much like party invitations or wedding announcements. Gambling isn't a party - it's entertainment that involves real money, and I need to trust that my money is safe.

Logo 4 is too aggressive - reminds me of those pushy salespeople who try too hard. When someone tries that hard to get your attention, I always wonder what they're trying to hide. My mother used to say 'empty barrels make the most noise,' and Logo 4 feels like an empty barrel.

Logo 2 feels like a solid company run by people who care about their customers. That's the kind of company I want to trust with my weekly entertainment budget."

**Trust Built Through:**
- Analogies to past professional experiences
- Personal/friend scam stories
- Professional reliability correlation
- Customer service expectations
- Licensing visibility assumptions
- Generational wisdom ("empty barrels")

**Red Flags:**
- Scripts = scam site similarity
- Aggressive = hiding something
- Party aesthetics = inappropriate seriousness

### Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Birthe's Response:**
"Logo 4 would catch my eye first - it's very bold. But you know, there's a story about that. When I was teaching, we had these colorful posters advertising after-school programs. The flashiest, most eye-catching posters were often for the programs that ended up being cancelled or poorly run. The reliable programs had simple, clear posters.

I think it's the same with these logos. Logo 4 would catch my eye, but then I'd think 'why are they trying so hard?' and I'd probably keep looking.

Logo 2 would stand out in a different way - by being calm and professional among all the flashy gambling apps. It's like when you're in a noisy room and someone speaks quietly but clearly - you actually pay more attention because they're different from all the shouting.

At my age, I'm drawn to things that look trustworthy rather than things that are just loud. Logo 2 would catch my attention because it looks different from the typical gambling site - it looks safe and reliable."

**Analysis:**
- Life experience shapes attention
- Flashy = unreliable (pattern from teaching)
- Professional contrast = effective differentiation
- Age-appropriate attention drivers
- Quality over volume
- Storytelling to explain reasoning

### Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Birthe's Response:**
"Logo 2 represents 'Play Made Easy' best. Let me tell you what 'easy' means to someone my age who's not very comfortable with technology.

My sister tried to get me to use online gambling a few years ago, and I was so worried about making mistakes. What if I accidentally bet too much? What if I couldn't figure out how to stop? What if I pressed the wrong button and lost money?

'Easy' needs to mean:
- Easy to understand the rules
- Easy to set limits so I don't overspend
- Easy to contact someone if I have problems
- Easy to trust that it's safe

Logo 2 looks like a company that would make it easy in these ways. It's clear and simple, not confusing. Logo 3 and Logo 6 with their fancy script writing make me think the platform would be complicated and confusing - if they can't even make their logo simple, how complicated is their website?

I remember when one of my teacher colleagues tried an online bingo site with a very fancy logo. She called me crying because she couldn't figure out how to withdraw her money - the site was so complicated! Logo 2 looks like it would be straightforward and clear, not tricky and confusing.

That's what 'easy' should mean for people like me - clear, safe, and not confusing."

**"Easy" Interpreted As:**
- Age-appropriate usability
- Safety and limits
- Clear navigation
- Support accessibility
- Not confusing or tricky
- Trust-enabling simplicity

**Personal Stories:**
- Sister's encouragement
- Technology anxiety
- Colleague's confusion story
- Real user needs from experience

### Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Birthe's Response:**
"I would only consider downloading an app with Logo 2. Here's why - and this is from experience.

After what happened to Anne, my sister did a lot of research on gambling sites. She compared many of them, checked their licenses, read reviews. She found one she trusted and recommended it to me. The site she chose had a logo very similar to Logo 2 - clean, professional, trustworthy-looking.

When I first saw that site, I felt safe enough to try it. The professional logo made me think 'this is a real company, not a scam.' And I was right - it's been reliable, they've always processed my withdrawals quickly, and their customer service once helped me when I accidentally set my limit wrong.

Now, when I look at these logos, I compare them to what I know works. Logo 2 looks like a trustworthy company. Logo 3, Logo 6, and Logo 4 look like the site that scammed Anne - trying too hard to look fun or exciting, but probably not trustworthy underneath.

At 56, I'm cautious about new technology. I need visible safety signals before I'll trust a new app with my money. Logo 2 provides those signals. The others make me nervous because I've heard too many stories about people getting scammed by sites that looked too flashy or casual.

I'd only download Logo 2. The others remind me of mistakes I've seen friends make."

**Download Decision Factors:**
1. Personal network experience (sister's research)
2. Similarity to trusted platform
3. Professional appearance = safety
4. Past success with similar design
5. Age-appropriate caution
6. Scam stories create filters
7. Need for visible safety signals

### Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and briefly explain your reasoning for each.

**Birthe's Rankings:**

**1st Place: Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)**
"This is the clear winner. It reminds me of the gambling site my sister recommended - professional, trustworthy, safe. It looks like a real company that would have proper licensing, good customer service, and wouldn't disappear with your money. After Anne's bad experience, this is exactly what I look for. Professional and trustworthy."

**2nd Place: Logo 5 (Bold outline)**
"This one is also professional and clean. It's modern - maybe a bit too modern for me, but it still looks trustworthy. It doesn't have the fancy scripts or aggressive effects that worry me. I'd consider this one, though I prefer Logo 2 because it feels more established and reliable."

**3rd Place: Logo 7 (YS monogram)**
"Very simple and professional. Maybe too simple - it doesn't tell me much about the company. But it doesn't have any of the warning signs I look for (flashy effects, casual scripts). It's safe, but I'd want to do more research because the logo alone doesn't give me enough information to trust them. Still better than the flashy ones though."

**Ranking Pattern:**
- Trust from similarity to known-good
- Professional appearance essential
- Personal stories justify choices
- Age and experience inform preferences
- Safety over excitement
- Elimination of red flags

### Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Birthe's Response:**
"I'd eliminate four of them right away, and I can tell you exactly why based on things I've learned:

**Logo 3 and Logo 6 (Both Scripts) - Eliminated**
These remind me so much of the site that scammed Anne! They look like wedding invitations or party flyers, not serious companies handling money. I remember Anne showing me the logo of that scam site - it had fancy script writing just like these. She said it looked 'elegant' and 'fun,' but it turned out they weren't licensed properly and made it nearly impossible to withdraw money.

Gambling sites need to look professional and serious, not like party invitations. When I see these script logos, I immediately think of Anne's story and get worried. They don't look like companies that would have proper customer service or clear licensing. My sister always says 'if it looks too casual, stay away' - and these are too casual. Eliminated immediately.

**Logo 4 (Bold shadow) - Eliminated**
This one worries me because it's too aggressive and pushy. It reminds me of those door-to-door salespeople who won't take no for an answer. My husband used to say 'if someone's trying too hard to sell you something, they're probably selling something bad.'

I also remember reading in a consumer magazine about warning signs for online scams, and they said to watch out for sites with overly flashy designs that try to create excitement. Logo 4 feels like that - trying to create drama and excitement instead of trust and reliability. At my age, I don't need drama - I need safety. Eliminated.

**Logo 1 (Tilted stamp) - Eliminated**
The tilted angle bothers me. Why is it tilted? It makes everything feel unstable. When I was teaching, we had a saying: 'keep things straight and clear.' This logo isn't straight - it's off-kilter, and that makes me worry that other things about the company might be off-kilter too.

Also, my sister's friend tried a gambling site that had a logo with lots of unusual effects and angles. The site turned out to have all sorts of hidden fees and confusing terms. When things look unnecessarily complicated or 'quirky,' I get suspicious. This stamp thing feels gimmicky, and gimmicks make me nervous when real money is involved. Eliminated.

Only Logo 2, 5, and 7 look professional and trustworthy enough for me to even consider. The others remind me of too many bad stories I've heard from friends."

**Elimination Based On:**
- Personal network scam stories
- Pattern recognition from friend's mistake
- Generational wisdom ("if someone's trying too hard...")
- Consumer protection awareness
- Stability and clarity preferences
- Professional standards required
