## Phase 2A Questions & Responses

### Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Lisbeth's Response:**
"I like Logo 2 the most. My sister and I play on a gambling site together, and their logo looks similar to Logo 2 - professional and trustworthy. When my sister first recommended the site to me, she said 'look how professional it looks - that's how you know it's legitimate.' She was right, and we've been using it for two years without any problems.

Logo 2 has that same professional look. It's the kind of logo that makes people feel confident recommending it to friends and family. When I talk to colleagues who gamble, the sites they trust all have clean, professional logos like this. Good reputation starts with looking reputable, and Logo 2 does that."

**Key Themes:**
- Sister's recommendation influential
- Similarity to trusted platform
- Professional = recommendable
- Social validation important
- Reputation tied to appearance

### Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Lisbeth's Response:**
"Logo 2, definitely. People I trust recommend platforms that look like this. My sister is very careful about which gambling sites she uses - she reads reviews, checks licensing, asks friends. The site she chose for us has a professional logo similar to Logo 2, and it's been completely trustworthy.

I also asked a colleague who gambles occasionally, and she said the same thing - the trustworthy sites all have clean, professional branding. Sites with fancy scripts or aggressive designs often have poor reputations or customer service problems.

Logo 2 has the look of a platform that would have:
- Good reviews on Trustpilot
- Positive word-of-mouth
- People recommending it to friends
- Good reputation in the community

That's what trust looks like - not just the logo itself, but knowing that other people trust it too. Logo 2 looks like something people would feel comfortable recommending, and that's the strongest trust signal."

**Trust Built Through:**
- Sister's vetting process
- Colleague validation
- Review site expectations
- Word-of-mouth predictions
- Community reputation
- Recommendability as trust proxy

**Social Trust Framework:**
- Peer recommendations
- Community consensus
- Review credibility
- Referral confidence

### Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Lisbeth's Response:**
"Logo 4 would catch your eye first because it's bold and aggressive. But here's the thing - people I know wouldn't recommend something that looks like Logo 4. They'd say 'it looks pushy' or 'seems like they're trying too hard.'

Logo 2 would stand out in a better way - it looks trustworthy enough that people would screenshot it and send it to friends saying 'have you tried this one?' That's actual standout value - being share-worthy and recommendable.

My sister and I are always sharing app recommendations in our family group chat. Professional-looking apps like Logo 2 get shared and recommended. Flashy ones like Logo 4 get skeptical reactions. So Logo 2 stands out in the way that actually matters - it's the one people would talk about positively and recommend to others."

**Analysis:**
- Aggressive attention ≠ positive attention
- Share-worthy as metric
- Social media recommendation test
- Family group chat dynamics
- Peer-validated standout
- Recommendability > visibility

### Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Lisbeth's Response:**
"Logo 2 represents 'Play Made Easy' because 'easy' should include:
- Easy to trust (good reputation)
- Easy to recommend to friends
- Easy to explain why it's safe
- Easy to get others to join

When my sister invited me to play on her gambling site, it was easy for me to say yes because the platform looked professional and trustworthy. If she'd recommended something with a casual script logo like Logo 3 or Logo 6, I would have been more hesitant - how would I explain to my husband that I'm gambling on a site that looks like a party invitation?

Logo 2 makes it easy to trust, easy to join, and easy to feel good about playing. That's what 'Play Made Easy' should mean - easy to feel confident about, not just easy to use.

People I know say the same thing - the best gambling platforms are the ones that look professional enough that you don't feel embarrassed recommending them. Logo 2 fits that perfectly."

**"Easy" Interpreted As:**
- Easy to trust
- Easy to recommend
- Easy to justify to family
- Easy social acceptance
- Easy peer validation
- Easy reputation explanation

**Social Dynamics:**
- Sister invitation scenario
- Husband explanation test
- Confidence in recommendation
- Social acceptability

### Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Lisbeth's Response:**
"I wouldn't download any gambling app without a recommendation from someone I trust - probably my sister or a close colleague. But Logo 2 would be the one they'd most likely recommend to me.

Here's my thought process: if my sister saw Logo 2 in the app store, she'd think 'this looks trustworthy, let me check the reviews.' If the reviews are good, she'd try it and then recommend it to me. That's how I discover new platforms - through trusted recommendations.

With Logo 3, 6, or 4, my sister would probably skip right past them. She'd say they don't look professional enough to waste time investigating. So those logos would never even make it to the recommendation stage.

Logo 2 looks like something that would pass my sister's evaluation and then get recommended to me. That's what would actually lead to me downloading - not the logo alone, but the logo making it recommendable enough that trusted people in my network would suggest it.

Also, if I did download Logo 2 based on my sister's recommendation and it was good, I'd feel confident recommending it to other friends. With the flashy or casual logos, I'd be less likely to recommend even if the platform was good, because they don't look as reputable. Good reputation needs to look good."

**Download Path:**
1. Trusted person discovers
2. Logo passes professional filter
3. Investigation warranted
4. Reviews checked
5. Trial and validation
6. Recommendation to network
7. Download based on referral

**Key Insight:**
- Logo enables recommendability
- Recommendation triggers download
- Not direct logo → download
- But logo → recommendation → download

### Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and briefly explain your reasoning for each.

**Lisbeth's Rankings:**

**1st Place: Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)**
"This is what people I trust would recommend. It looks professional, trustworthy, and has the kind of good reputation signals that make it easy to recommend to friends and family. My sister would approve of this one, and that matters to me."

**2nd Place: Logo 5 (Bold outline)**
"Also professional and clean. People I know would consider this trustworthy too. Not quite as refined as Logo 2, but still has good reputation potential. Would feel comfortable if someone recommended this."

**3rd Place: Logo 7 (YS monogram)**
"Simple and professional. Maybe a bit too simple - harder to remember and talk about with friends. But it looks trustworthy, which is important. If my sister recommended this, I'd trust her judgment."

**Ranking Pattern:**
- Recommendability primary factor
- Sister's approval hypothetical
- Reputation potential
- Social acceptance
- Trust through peers

### Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Lisbeth's Response:**
"I'd eliminate four logos, mostly because people I trust wouldn't recommend them:

**Logo 3 and Logo 6 (Scripts) - Eliminated**
These look too casual and informal. My sister is very practical and careful - she wouldn't recommend gambling sites that look like party invitations. When I ask colleagues about gambling sites, they always emphasize choosing ones that 'look legitimate and professional.' These scripts don't meet that standard.

Also, from an HR perspective, I know reputation matters. A company with casual branding often has casual business practices. Good reputation comes from professional presentation. These logos would have reputation problems - people wouldn't feel confident recommending them, so they'd struggle with word-of-mouth growth. That's a red flag for trustworthiness.

**Logo 4 (Bold shadow) - Eliminated**
Too aggressive. People I know actively warn against gambling sites that look too flashy or pushy. My sister has said 'avoid sites that try too hard with their design - they're usually compensating for poor service.' Logo 4 fits that warning.

Also, I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending something this aggressive to friends. It doesn't look like a platform with good customer reviews or positive reputation. It looks like something that would have complaints. Eliminated.

**Logo 1 (Tilted stamp) - Eliminated**
Gimmicky and confusing. People I trust value straightforward, clear platforms. This tilted design seems unnecessarily complicated. My sister would probably say 'why is it tilted? That's weird.' Weird doesn't build trust or good reputation.

Also, it's hard to describe to others - 'it's like a tilted stamp thing?' That's not a good recommendation pitch. If I can't easily describe it to friends in a positive way, it's not worth considering. Eliminated.

Only Logo 2, 5, and 7 look like platforms that people I trust would research, try, and potentially recommend. The others fail the social trust test - they don't look recommendable, so they wouldn't build good reputation."

**Social Elimination Criteria:**
- Sister wouldn't recommend (scripts, gimmicks)
- Colleague warnings applied (aggressive)
- Reputation prediction (casual = problems)
- Recommendability test (can't pitch tilted stamp)
- Word-of-mouth viability
- HR professional lens (presentation = practices)
