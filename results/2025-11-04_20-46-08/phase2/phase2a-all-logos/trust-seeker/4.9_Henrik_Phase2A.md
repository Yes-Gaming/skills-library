## Phase 2A Questions & Responses

### Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Henrik's Response:**
"I think... maybe Logo 2? I'm not entirely sure, but it seems the most... safe? Professional? I'm concerned that gambling might not be right for me at all, so if I were to use a platform, it would need to look very trustworthy and secure. Logo 2 seems like it might be that kind of platform, though I'd still need to do a lot more research before I'd feel comfortable.

The others make me nervous for different reasons. Logo 4 seems too aggressive - maybe they'd try to get me to gamble more than I should? Logo 3 and 6 seem too casual - maybe they don't take security seriously? I'm very worried about data privacy and addiction risks, so I need something that looks like they have proper safeguards.

Logo 2 seems like... maybe it could be trustworthy? But I'm not certain. I'd need to verify licensing, read lots of reviews, maybe talk to my brother who knows about these things... I guess Logo 2, but with significant reservations."

**Key Themes:**
- Fundamental uncertainty about gambling
- Heavy hedging ("maybe," "I think," "not sure")
- Multiple concerns expressed
- Need for extensive verification
- Risk aversion dominant
- Professional = potentially safer

### Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Henrik's Response:**
"This is difficult because I'm not sure if any gambling platform can be fully trustworthy... but if I had to choose, maybe Logo 2?

I'm very worried about security and data privacy. I work in civil service, so I'm cautious about giving out personal information and payment details. Logo 2 looks more professional than the others, which might mean they have better security practices? But I'm not certain - professional appearance doesn't guarantee good security, does it?

I'm concerned that:
- Logo 4's aggressive design might indicate aggressive business practices
- Logo 3 and 6's casual appearance might mean casual security measures
- Logo 1's tilted design makes me worry if other aspects are also 'off'
- Logo 5 seems okay but maybe too bold - are they overconfident about something?
- Logo 7 is very minimal - maybe too minimal? Are they hiding information?

Logo 2 seems like the safest choice, but I'm still worried. Would they have proper encryption? Strong data protection? Clear responsible gambling tools? Transparent licensing? I'd need to verify all of this thoroughly before trusting any platform.

Maybe Logo 2 is trustworthy, but I'd need significant reassurance."

**Trust Concerns:**
- Security and data privacy paramount
- Professional ≠ guaranteed safety
- Multiple "what if" scenarios
- Extensive verification needed
- Constant worry expression
- Hedging on all assessments

**Red Flag Sensitivity:**
- Each logo triggers specific worry
- Worst-case thinking
- Risk identification focus
- No confident trust given

### Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Henrik's Response:**
"Logo 4 would probably stand out most because it's very bold and dramatic. But that concerns me - why do they need to be so attention-grabbing? Maybe they're trying to attract impulsive people who don't think carefully about risks?

I'm not sure standing out is even a good thing for a gambling app. When I was researching gambling platforms - which took me about four months before I felt comfortable trying anything - I actually avoided the flashy, attention-grabbing ones. They seemed designed to exploit impulsive behavior, which worried me.

Logo 2 might stand out, but in a different way - by looking professional and safe. That's what caught my attention when I was researching. But I'm concerned that maybe I'm just drawn to professional appearance and it might not actually indicate safety... How can you really tell from a logo?

I guess Logo 4 stands out most, but that makes me worried about who else it's attracting and what the platform's real intentions are. Maybe standing out isn't the right goal for a gambling app that claims to be responsible?"

**Analysis:**
- Visibility creates suspicion
- Attention = exploitation concern
- Professional preferred but uncertain
- Four-month research period revealed
- Worried about other users attracted
- Questions goals and intentions

### Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Henrik's Response:**
"I'm not sure if 'Play Made Easy' is even the right message for gambling... Should gambling be 'easy'? That concerns me. Maybe it should be 'Play Made Safe' or 'Play Made Responsible'?

But if I have to interpret 'easy' charitably, maybe Logo 2? I think 'easy' should mean:
- Easy to set strict limits (which I definitely need)
- Easy to find responsible gambling resources
- Easy to understand the risks
- Easy to stop if it becomes a problem
- Easy to protect my data and privacy

Logo 2 might represent that kind of 'easy,' but I'm not certain. The casual logos like Logo 3 and 6 seem to interpret 'easy' as 'carefree' or 'fun,' which really worries me. Gambling shouldn't be carefree - it involves real money and addiction risks.

I'm concerned that most of these logos don't seem to take the serious aspects seriously enough. Maybe Logo 2 does? But how can I be sure from just a logo? I'd need to examine their entire platform, read their responsible gambling policies, check their security measures...

Maybe Logo 2, but I'm worried about the 'Play Made Easy' message in general. It might encourage the wrong attitude toward gambling."

**"Easy" Concerns:**
- Fundamental worry about the tagline
- Should emphasize safety, not ease
- Protective features needed
- Addiction risk consciousness
- Data privacy priority
- Carefree = dangerous

**Extensive Hedging:**
- "Maybe," "I'm not sure," "concerns me"
- Questions premise of question
- Need for comprehensive verification
- Can't conclude from logo alone

### Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Henrik's Response:**
"I'm very hesitant to download any gambling app... It took me four months of research before I tried my first platform, and even then I only deposited 100 kroner as a test. I'm still not sure if it was the right decision.

If I were to consider downloading something new - which I'm not sure I would, because I'm barely comfortable with what I'm using now - Logo 2 might be the only one I'd even consider. And 'consider' means:

Maybe it would make it onto my research list, where I would:
- Spend weeks reading reviews on Trustpilot and other sites
- Verify Spillemyndigheden licensing multiple times
- Read their entire privacy policy and terms of service
- Research the company's history and ownership
- Look for any complaints or regulatory issues
- Try to find independent security audits
- Ask my brother who's more knowledgeable about these things
- Set up a test account with minimal deposit (maybe 50 kroner)
- Test their responsible gambling tools extensively
- Monitor for any suspicious behavior

And only after all of that - if everything checked out, which I'd still doubt - might I actually use it. Logo 2 looks professional enough that I might add it to my research list. But the others? I'm concerned they'd fail my evaluation before I even started.

Logo 3, 6, 4, 1 - I don't think I could bring myself to research platforms with those logos. They trigger too many concerns about security, professionalism, and responsible gambling practices.

So maybe Logo 2 would lead to download... eventually... after extensive verification... if everything checked out... which I'd still be worried about."

**Download Path:**
1. Months of research
2. Extensive verification
3. Security audits checked
4. Minimal test deposit
5. Constant monitoring
6. Persistent doubt

**Key Insight:**
- Logo as initial filter only
- Extreme risk aversion
- Can't trust without verification
- Professional appearance necessary but insufficient
- Most logos immediately disqualifying

### Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and briefly explain your reasoning for each.

**Henrik's Rankings:**

**1st Place: Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)**
"I think this might be the safest option? It looks professional and maybe trustworthy, though I'm not certain. It doesn't trigger as many concerns as the others. If I were forced to choose, this would be it, but I'd still have significant reservations and would need extensive verification before trusting it."

**2nd Place: Logo 7 (YS monogram)**
"Very simple and professional. Maybe too simple - I'm not sure if that's good or bad. Could mean they're minimalist and focused, or could mean they're not transparent. I'd need to investigate further. It's acceptable but raises questions."

**3rd Place: Logo 5 (Bold outline)**
"Clean and modern, but I'm concerned about the boldness. Does it indicate overconfidence? Are they making promises they can't keep? It seems okay on the surface, but I'd be skeptical. Third choice with reservations."

**Ranking Pattern:**
- Extreme hedging on all choices
- Constant concern expression
- No confident preference
- Verification needed for all
- Questions even top choice
- "Least concerning" vs. "most preferred"

### Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Henrik's Response:**
"I would eliminate four immediately, though I'm worried about all of them to some degree:

**Logo 3 and Logo 6 (Scripts) - Too Concerning**
These really worry me. They look too casual, like they don't take security or responsible gambling seriously. I'm very concerned about data privacy - would a company with this casual appearance have proper encryption? Strong password requirements? Data protection compliance?

I'm also worried about responsible gambling. These logos suggest fun and casualness, which might attract people who don't think carefully about addiction risks. Would they have proper self-exclusion tools? Reality checks? Deposit limits? I'm not sure, and that concerns me enough to eliminate them.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I can't take the risk of finding out.

**Logo 4 (Bold shadow) - Very Concerning**
This logo really worries me. It's so aggressive and attention-seeking. I'm concerned it's designed to appeal to impulsive behavior, which is dangerous for gambling. Would they use manipulative tactics? Dark patterns? Aggressive retention strategies?

I'm very worried about addiction risks, and Logo 4 seems designed to create excitement rather than promote responsible behavior. That's concerning enough to eliminate it immediately. Maybe it's fine, but I can't take that chance.

**Logo 1 (Tilted stamp) - Questionable**
The tilted design makes me uncomfortable. Why is it tilted? What does that represent? I'm worried it might indicate other aspects that are also 'off' or unreliable. It seems gimmicky, and gimmicks in gambling worry me - are they trying to distract from something?

Maybe it's fine, but the uncertainty is too much. I need clarity and straightforwardness in gambling platforms because there's already so much risk. Eliminated because it raises too many questions.

I'm only comfortable - well, 'comfortable' is too strong - maybe 'minimally concerned' about Logo 2, 7, and 5. But I'd still need extensive verification for any of them. The eliminated ones worry me too much to even consider researching."

**Elimination Based On:**
- Maximum caution
- Worst-case scenarios
- Can't take risk of being wrong
- Professional appearance minimum requirement
- Casual = security concerns
- Aggressive = addiction concerns
- Gimmicky = reliability concerns
- Uncertainty = elimination
