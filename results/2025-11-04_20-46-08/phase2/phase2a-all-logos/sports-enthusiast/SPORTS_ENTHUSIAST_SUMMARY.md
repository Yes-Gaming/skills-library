## Key Themes Across Sports Enthusiast Segment

### 1. Trust vs. Visibility Trade-off
Sports bettors universally recognize Logo 4 has maximum visibility but question whether high visibility correlates with trustworthiness. Majority conclude it doesn't.

**Representative tension:**
- Logo 4: "Catches attention but raises trust questions"

- **Ritual speed:** Familiar muscle memory (favors Logo 1's distinctive shape)

Even enthusiastic, brief, and social personas acknowledged Logo 2's professional superiority for trust metrics. Sports betting involves real money in time-sensitive contexts - professionalism matters.

### 4. Skepticism of Aggressive Styling
Multiple personas (2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.9, 2.10) explicitly called out aggressive styling as potential red flag for predatory practices or substance over style issues.
