## Preference Patterns

### Trust vs. Visibility Tension

## Recommendations for Next Phase

### Phase 2B Top 3 Candidates (Based on Sports Enthusiast Data)
1. **Logo 2** (27 points) - Clear leader
2. **Logo 1** (19 points) - Strong secondary
3. **Logo 4** (18 points) - Polarizing but noteworthy

### Alternative Consideration
Replace Logo 4 with Logo 5 (4 points) to test three universally acceptable options:
- **Pro:** Eliminates polarization, tests range of professional approaches
- **Con:** Loses data on visibility vs. trust trade-off

**Recommendation:** Proceed with 2, 1, 4 to understand polarization dynamics in Phase 2B

### Questions for Phase 2B
- Will Logo 4's trust concerns persist when only compared to other finalists?
- Can Logo 1 close the gap with Logo 2 in head-to-head scenarios?
- Does narrowing to 3 logos change perception of Logo 4's aggressiveness?

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
✅ **Authentic communication styles:** Each persona maintains distinct voice throughout
✅ **Consistent prioritization:** Sports-specific needs (speed, trust) drive decisions
✅ **Realistic tension:** Personas acknowledge trade-offs (visibility vs. trust)
✅ **Varied perspectives:** 10 communication styles provide diverse viewpoints
✅ **Detailed reasoning:** Sufficient explanation for preference patterns

### Limitations
⚠️ **Synthetic data:** Not real user testing, AI-generated personas
⚠️ **Single segment:** Only Sports Enthusiast data (need other 4 personas for complete picture)
⚠️ **No visual rendering:** Personas described logos verbally, didn't see actual designs
⚠️ **Time pressure simulation:** Live betting urgency described but not experienced

### Mitigation Strategies
- Cross-validate with other persona segments (Casual Entertainer, Casino Explorer, Trust Seeker, Cross-Entertainment)
- Compare synthetic findings to real user data when available
- Use Phase 2A as directional insight, not definitive answer
- Test actual logo designs with real users before final decision
