## Phase 2A Questions & Responses

### Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

I guess... maybe Logo 2? I'm not entirely certain, but it seems like the safest choice. It looks professional and not too aggressive, which makes me feel a bit more comfortable. I'm always worried about betting apps that look too flashy or pushy - Logo 2 seems more... restrained? Maybe that means they're more responsible about gambling limits and things like that? I could be wrong, but that's my initial feeling. Not 100% sure though.

---

### Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2, I think? It's hard to say for certain, but the clean design makes me feel like maybe they're more transparent about things. I'm always concerned about hidden terms or aggressive marketing tactics, and Logo 2 seems like it might be more straightforward? Though I'm not sure if you can really judge a platform's trustworthiness from a logo alone. I'd probably need to research their licensing and read reviews before I could say for sure. But if I had to choose just based on appearance... Logo 2 seems least likely to be problematic? Maybe?

---

### Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

I suppose Logo 4 would stand out most, but I'm not certain that's a good thing? When apps are too bold and attention-grabbing, I sometimes worry they're compensating for something or trying to trigger impulsive decisions. Maybe I'm being too cautious, but the bold shadow design makes me a bit nervous - like it's trying too hard to get my attention. That said, objectively speaking, yes, it would probably catch my eye first in an app store. I'm just not sure if that's what I actually want?

---

### Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Maybe Logo 2? Though I'm not entirely sure what "Play Made Easy" means in this context. If it means simple and straightforward without pressure, then Logo 2 seems to fit that? The clean design suggests ease without being too casual about gambling, which I appreciate because betting isn't actually "easy" or simple - there are real financial risks. Logo 1 could also work with the stamp design suggesting simplicity... I'm not certain which is better. Is it okay to be uncertain? Both seem reasonable, but I'd lean toward Logo 2 for safety.

---

### Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Honestly, I'm not sure I'd download any betting app based on logo alone - I'd need to check if it's licensed by Spillemyndigheden, read the responsible gambling policies, check if they have deposit limits... But if I had to choose just from these logos, maybe Logo 2? It seems like it might belong to a more responsible platform? I could be completely wrong about that. Logo 4 would actually make me less likely to download it - too aggressive, makes me nervous. Logo 2 feels safer, though I can't say for certain why I feel that way.

---

### Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

**1st: Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)**
I think this is my first choice? It seems professional and not manipulative, which matters to me given my concerns about responsible gambling. The clean design makes me feel like maybe the platform would be transparent about odds and limits. I'm not certain, but it feels like the least risky option. Though "least risky" might not be the most confident endorsement... but it's what I genuinely think.

**2nd: Logo 1 (Tilted stamp)**
Maybe second choice? The stamp design seems somewhat official and straightforward, which I appreciate. I'm a bit worried the tilt might be trying to make betting seem more casual than it is, but it's not as aggressive as some other options. Could be good, could be just okay. I'm not entirely sure. It feels more approachable than Logo 2 but still reasonably professional? Hard to say definitively.

**3rd: Logo 5 (Bold outline)**
I guess third place? It's bold but not as aggressive as Logo 4, which makes me feel slightly more comfortable with it. Not sure if I actually like it or if I'm just picking it because I need a third choice. It would probably work fine, though I'm not confident about it. Maybe it's too bold for my taste, or maybe it's fine. Sorry, I know I should be more decisive, but these choices are difficult for me.

### Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

I'm pretty certain about eliminating Logo 4. That bold shadow design makes me nervous - it feels too aggressive and pushy, like it's trying to pressure me into impulsive decisions. Maybe I'm being overly cautious, but given my concerns about responsible gambling, anything that feels manipulative or pressure-inducing is concerning. I worry platforms with aggressive branding might not prioritize user safety.

Logos 3 and 6 with the script styling also make me uncomfortable, though I'm not entirely sure why. Maybe because they seem to be making betting look soft or harmless when it's actually a financial risk? I'm worried about gambling apps that downplay the serious aspects. The script feels like it's trying to be too casual or friendly about something that involves real money and real risks.

Logo 7 confuses me. What does YS stand for? I don't like uncertainty in financial contexts, and a logo I can't immediately understand makes me nervous. Maybe it's fine and I'm being too cautious, but I'd probably eliminate it just to be safe. Though I could be wrong about that...

I'm sorry if these answers aren't confident enough. I just want to be careful about betting-related decisions.

## Speed & Recognition Assessment
**Live betting context:** Speed is important, but so is feeling safe about the platform.

**Best for careful betting:** Maybe Logo 2? I think? If I'm placing small, careful bets during matches (which I do very cautiously), I'd want an app that looks trustworthy and professional. Logo 2 gives me that feeling, though I'm not 100% certain why. It seems like it would belong to a platform that has good responsible gambling features, which matters more to me than pure speed.

**Concerns about "speed" optimization:** I'm actually a bit worried about apps being TOO fast or frictionless for betting. As someone concerned about responsible gambling, maybe a tiny bit of friction is good? Not that the app should be slow, but... I don't know, maybe making betting too easy isn't always good? Logo 2 suggests efficiency without feeling like it's trying to remove all barriers to spending money.

**Uncertainty note:** I realize I'm supposed to evaluate these for quick recognition during matches, but honestly, I'm more concerned about whether the platform behind these logos would have good deposit limits and reality checks. Logo 2 feels most likely to come from a responsible operator, even though I can't say that with certainty.
