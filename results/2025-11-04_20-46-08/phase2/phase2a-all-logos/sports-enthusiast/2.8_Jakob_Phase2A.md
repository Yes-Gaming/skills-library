## Phase 2A Questions & Responses

### Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

I think most people would say Logo 4. Everyone in my friend group responds to bold, confident branding - it's the kind of logo that looks good when you screenshot your winning bet slip to share in our WhatsApp group. My friends who bet all use apps with strong visual presence, and Logo 4 has that energy. It's the kind of logo you'd see other people using and think "that looks legit." Plus it would stand out in Instagram stories when we share our match day bets.

---

### Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2 for trust. People I know in marketing always say clean, professional design signals reliability. When we discuss betting apps in my friend group, the ones everyone trusts most have that polished, straightforward look - not too flashy, not trying too hard. Logo 2 looks like the kind of app that my more serious betting friends would recommend. It's got that "everyone uses this because it's solid" vibe rather than "this is trying to get your attention" vibe.

---

### Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Definitely Logo 4. Everyone would notice this one first. It's got that bold presence that cuts through - similar to how the most popular betting apps market themselves. When you're scrolling through options with friends trying to decide which app to use for the weekend matches, Logo 4 is the one that makes you stop. My friends in social media marketing always talk about "thumb-stopping content" - Logo 4 does that for logos.

---

### Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Logo 1 represents "Play Made Easy" in a way my friends would relate to. Everyone in my betting league likes the stamp design - someone in our group actually mentioned it looks "clean and easy to understand" when we were discussing betting apps last week. The tilt makes it feel approachable and fun, which is what "easy" means in a social context - not complicated or intimidating. People I know would feel comfortable using an app with this logo.

---

### Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Logo 4 would make me download it first. Everyone responds to confidence in branding, and that bold style projects confidence. It's the kind of logo where if a friend showed me they were using it, I'd think "okay, this looks like a real platform." Plus, in our friend group, we tend to gravitate toward apps that look modern and established - Logo 4 has that presence. When we're all deciding which app to use for our Premier League betting pool, visual impact matters.

---

### Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

**1st: Logo 4 (Bold shadow)**
My friends would all choose this one. It's got that social proof feeling - looks like something popular and established. When you're sharing bet slips in group chats or posting winning bets on stories, Logo 4 looks credible and exciting. Everyone I know in betting groups uses apps with strong, confident branding. This one fits what people expect from a sports betting app.

**2nd: Logo 1 (Tilted stamp)**
People I know really like the stamp aesthetic - it's distinctive and memorable. Someone in our betting league actually said logos with character are more shareable than generic ones. The tilt gives it personality that would make it recognizable when people share screenshots. My friends who care about design (several work in creative fields) would appreciate this one. Good balance of professional and personable.

**3rd: Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)**
Everyone says clean design = trustworthy platform. While it's not as exciting as Logo 4 or as characterful as Logo 1, people I know who take betting seriously prefer this polished, professional look. My friend who bets regularly on football always recommends apps that "look like they know what they're doing" - Logo 2 has that quality. Solid choice even if not the most exciting.

---

### Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

Logo 7 - everyone in my friend group would be confused by this. "What's YS?" someone would ask in our chat. People say logos should be immediately clear, especially for betting apps where you need to quickly find and tap during live matches. My friends wouldn't want to use an app where they have to explain or remember what the initials mean.

Logos 3 and 6 - people I know think script fonts are wrong for sports betting. Everyone associates script with feminine brands or wedding stuff, not football betting. Someone in our WhatsApp group actually made fun of a betting app with script styling once, saying it looked like a nail salon logo. My friends would definitely roast me if I suggested using an app with these logos. Wrong vibe for social betting culture.

Logo 5 - just okay but nothing special. Everyone would probably forget this one immediately. My friends respond to logos that have personality or strong presence. Logo 5 is just... there. In our group chat discussions about which apps to use, this one wouldn't generate any excitement or interest. People want either professional polish (Logo 2) or bold confidence (Logo 4), not generic middle ground.

## Speed & Recognition Assessment
**Live betting context:** Social betting means quick app access while watching with friends.

**Best for social context:** Logo 4 - when we're all watching a match together at someone's place or at a sports bar, you need to quickly pull up your app to place bets. Logo 4's boldness makes it easy to spot on your home screen while also looking good when friends inevitably glance at your phone. Everyone can quickly see you're using a legit betting app.

**Worst for social context:** Logo 7 - my friends would see "YS" on my screen and ask what app that is. Creates unnecessary conversation when you're trying to quickly place a bet during the match. People say your betting app should be instantly recognizable.

**Social proof factor:** Logo 4 looks like something everyone would use, which matters in social betting. Logo 1 is distinctive enough to be conversation-starter in a good way. Logo 2 is professional enough that no one would question your choice.
