## Phase 2A Questions & Responses

### Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

Logo 4! YES! That's the one right there! The bold shadow just POPS - it's got energy, it's got power, it captures that feeling when you're watching a match and your bet is about to come through! When I'm at the stadium or watching with the lads, I want an app that feels as alive as the game itself. Logo 4 has that intensity. It's not boring, it's not timid - it's BOLD and exciting, just like football should be!

---

### Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2 for trust. Look, I love the energy of Logo 4, but when it comes to actually trusting my money with someone, Logo 2 feels solid and professional. It's clean, it's serious, it looks like they know what they're doing. When my bet hits during the 90th minute and I'm going crazy celebrating, I need to trust that the platform is going to pay out properly! Logo 2 has that trustworthy vibe - like they're not messing around, they're running a proper operation.

---

### Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Absolutely Logo 4! No question! That shadow, that BOLDNESS - it jumps off the screen! When you're scrolling through betting apps looking for one to use for match day, Logo 4 grabs your attention like a last-minute goal! It's got presence, it's got impact. The other logos are fine, but Logo 4 is the one that makes you stop and pay attention. That's what you need in sports betting - something that matches the excitement of the game!

---

### Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Logo 1 captures "Play Made Easy" perfectly! The tilted stamp design is fun and energetic - it's got personality! It says "Hey, this is about having a good time, not getting stressed." When I'm betting on matches, I want it to be FUN and EASY, not complicated with a bunch of confusing menus. That little tilt in the stamp makes it feel approachable and exciting at the same time. It's like the logo is saying "Come on, let's have some fun with this!"

---

### Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Logo 4 would make me hit download immediately! That boldness tells me this app is going to deliver excitement. When I see that logo, I think "These guys understand what sports betting is about - ENERGY and PASSION!" I'd look at that app icon and think "Yeah, this is going to be fun, this is going to have the rush I'm looking for." Some of these other logos look boring or too formal - Logo 4 looks like it was made for match day adrenaline!

---

### Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

**1st: Logo 4 (Bold shadow)**
THIS IS IT! This logo has EVERYTHING! It's bold, it's energetic, it's powerful! When I'm watching football and betting live, I want an app that matches my energy. That shadow effect makes it jump off the screen - it's got that same intensity as when you're watching your team score in the final minutes. Love it! This is the one that gets my heart racing just looking at it!

**2nd: Logo 1 (Tilted stamp)**
Great energy! The tilt gives it personality and fun vibes. It's not stiff and boring - it's got that playful spirit that makes betting FUN, which is what it should be! When I'm out with the other coaches watching Superliga matches, this is the kind of logo that feels right. It's approachable, it's exciting, it says "Let's enjoy this!"

**3rd: Logo 5 (Bold outline)**
Solid choice! Bold enough to have presence and energy, stands out well. Not quite as impactful as Logo 4, but it's still got that strength that says this app can handle the excitement of live betting. Good visibility, good energy - would definitely use it!

---

### Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

Logo 7 - what even is that? YS? Too confusing! When I'm trying to quick-tap my app during halftime to place a bet before the second half starts, I don't want to be hunting for some mysterious letters! Just tell me what you are!

Logos 3 and 6 - too fancy and soft! Script fonts feel wrong for sports betting. Football is passionate, loud, intense - not delicate cursive writing! These look like they belong on a wedding invitation, not a betting app. When my team scores and I want to celebrate with a quick bet on the next goal scorer, I need something with ENERGY, not elegant swirls.

Logo 2 is professional but it's a bit too calm for me personally - though I get why people trust it. Just doesn't have that match-day excitement I'm looking for!

---

## Speed & Recognition Assessment
**Live betting context:** During intense match moments, need instant access!

**Best for match-day energy:** Logo 4 - the boldness matches the adrenaline of live betting! When you're watching and the odds shift during a corner kick, you want an app that feels as alive as you do!

**Worst for match-day energy:** Logo 3 - way too soft and slow-feeling. Sports betting is fast and exciting, not gentle and elegant!

**Emotional connection:** Logo 4 makes me FEEL the excitement before I even open the app. That's huge! The logo should pump you up, not put you to sleep!
