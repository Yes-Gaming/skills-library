## Phase 2A Questions & Responses

### Q1: Overall Preference (Forced Choice)
**Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?**

Logo 1 reminds me of the old betting slips my father used to fill out at the local bookmaker's before the internet changed everything. There's a story behind that stamp design - it has authenticity, like those vintage football programs you'd get at Odense Stadion in the 80s and 90s. The tilted angle gives it character, like how the old ticket stubs would sit slightly crooked in your pocket after a match. It's modern enough for an app but still feels connected to the tradition of sports betting. When I place a bet on OB playing at home, I want to feel that connection to the ritual my father taught me, and Logo 1 captures that heritage while moving forward.

---

### Q2: Trust Leader (Forced Choice)
**Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?**

Logo 2 feels most trustworthy, though it doesn't tell much of a story. It's like the difference between a handshake from your father's generation - firm, direct, no nonsense - and the more elaborate greetings of today. There's something about that clean, professional design that says "we do what we say we'll do." Reminds me of the reliable shopkeeper who ran the sports store near my childhood home - nothing flashy, just quality and dependability. When you're trusting someone with your money during a football match, you want that straightforward honesty that Logo 2 represents.

---

### Q3: Standout/Visibility (Forced Choice)
**Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?**

Logo 4 would catch your eye first, like those bright advertising boards they installed at the new stadiums - impossible to miss but sometimes feels like they're shouting at you. Back when I was a kid, the old stadiums had painted signs that were bold but had character. Logo 4 has the boldness without the soul. It would definitely stand out in an app store, like a modern sports arena stands out compared to the traditional grounds, but I'm not sure that's always a good thing. Sometimes the loudest thing in the room isn't the most interesting - that's something I tell my students when we study history.

---

### Q4: Brand Fit (Forced Choice)
**Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?**

Logo 1 captures "Play Made Easy" in a way that has meaning. There's a story here - the stamp design is like those approval stamps on official documents, suggesting that betting is straightforward and validated. My father used to say that the best traditions are the ones that make sense, that aren't complicated just for the sake of being fancy. That tilted stamp says "this is simple, this is approved, this is how it should be done." The slight angle makes it feel approachable rather than rigid. It's like when a good teacher makes a complex historical event easy to understand without dumbing it down - Logo 1 does that visually.

---

### Q5: Download Intent (Forced Choice)
**If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?**

Logo 1 would make me download it because it tells a story I want to be part of. It's like when you're walking through an old part of town and you see a shop that's clearly been there for generations but has kept up with the times - that's what Logo 1 feels like. The stamp design connects to betting tradition (my father's generation, the pools, the bookmaker slips) while the modern execution says "but we're not stuck in the past." I'd download it thinking "these people understand where sports betting came from and respect that heritage." The other logos either feel too corporate (2), too aggressive (4), or trying too hard to be fancy (3, 6).

---

### Q6: Top 3 Ranking (Ranked Choice)
**Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd). Briefly explain your reasoning for each.**

**1st: Logo 1 (Tilted stamp)**
This one tells the best story. It's like the football scarves passed down from father to son - it honors tradition while being part of the present. The stamp aesthetic reminds me of the old football pools coupons, the match tickets from classic games, the validation stamp on betting slips from my father's time. But the modern, clean execution and that slight tilt bring it into today. When I bet on Superliga matches now, I'm continuing a tradition that goes back decades, and Logo 1 understands that. It has soul and history embedded in its design.

**2nd: Logo 2 (Refined lowercase)**
Clean and trustworthy, like a well-written history textbook - it gets the facts across without unnecessary decoration. It doesn't tell as compelling a story as Logo 1, but it tells an honest one: "we're professional, we're reliable, we're here to serve you well." Reminds me of the straightforward communication style of the old sportscasters - Svend Hansen calling football matches with clarity and authority, no gimmicks. Solid choice, though less emotionally resonant than Logo 1.

**3rd: Logo 4 (Bold shadow)**
Bold and visible like the new LED scoreboards at modern stadiums - effective but lacking the warmth of tradition. I rank it third because while it doesn't connect to betting heritage the way Logo 1 does, it at least has presence and confidence. It's like the new generation of football commentators - louder, more energetic, sometimes lacking depth but undeniably attention-grabbing. It would work, even if it's not my personal style.

---

### Q7: Immediate Eliminations (Open)
**Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?**

Logo 7 is eliminated immediately. There's no story there - just initials. It's like reading a historical document where all the context has been removed and you're left with just abbreviations. "YS" means nothing to me. One of the lessons I teach my students is that good communication requires clarity and context. My father could tell you about every significant match he'd bet on because the experience had meaning. "YS" removes that meaning. It's trying to be clever or exclusive when betting should be accessible and clear.

Logos 3 and 6 are eliminated because they're telling the wrong story. The script styling reminds me of wedding invitations or fancy restaurant menus - beautiful in their context, but completely wrong for sports betting. Sports betting is about passion, tradition, the roar of the crowd, the tension of a close match. It's not about elegance and flourishes. When my father took me to my first football match, everything about it was direct and genuine - the chants, the atmosphere, the straightforward joy or despair. These script logos feel like they're pretending betting is something delicate when it's actually raw and real.

Logo 5 I'd also eliminate, though less strongly than the others. It's just... there. It's bold but doesn't say anything. It's like a history lecture that hits the facts but misses the human story. It would function, but it wouldn't mean anything. After teaching history for years, I've learned that the facts alone aren't enough - you need the narrative that gives them meaning. Logo 5 lacks that narrative.

## Speed & Recognition Assessment
**Live betting context:** Match day rituals require both speed and meaning.

**Best for meaningful speed:** Logo 1 - I can spot it quickly because the stamp shape is distinctive, but more importantly, when I tap it during a match, I feel connected to the tradition. Speed isn't just about milliseconds; it's about the ritual being smooth and familiar. My father had his routine on match days, and now I have mine. Logo 1 fits into that ritual naturally.

**Story of speed:** When OB scored against FC Copenhagen last season in the 89th minute, I wanted to place a quick bet on them to win. The rush wasn't just about tapping an app fast - it was about being part of that moment, that tradition of fans backing their team. Logo 1 would make that moment feel right. Logo 4 would just make it feel frantic.
