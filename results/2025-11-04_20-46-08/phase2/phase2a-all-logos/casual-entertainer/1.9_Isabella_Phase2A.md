## Q1: OVERALL PREFERENCE

**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Isabella's Response:**

I guess... maybe Logo 2? I'm not entirely sure, but it seems like the safest choice. It's clean and doesn't look too aggressive or flashy, which makes me feel a bit more comfortable. I could be wrong, but I think I prefer things that are simple and don't try to grab too much attention. Maybe that's just me being cautious, but Logo 2 feels less intimidating than some of the others.

---

## Q2: TRUST ASSESSMENT

**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Isabella's Response:**

I think maybe Logo 2 feels most trustworthy? Though I'm not really sure what makes a gambling logo trustworthy... I guess the professional, clean look makes it seem more legitimate? Logo 6 might also be trustworthy because it looks friendly, but maybe that's suspicious? I don't know... when things are too friendly, sometimes they're trying to get you to let your guard down. But Logo 2 seems honest, I think. Maybe.

## Q3: STANDOUT/VISIBILITY

**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Isabella's Response:**

Logo 4 with the shadow would probably stand out more, I guess. Though I'm not certain if standing out is always good? Sometimes the apps that try really hard to get your attention are the ones you should be worried about, right? But if we're just talking about which one catches the eye, I think Logo 4 or maybe Logo 1 with the tilt. Though that tilt makes me a bit nervous - it feels a bit aggressive? I'm not sure.

---

## Q4: BRAND FIT

**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Isabella's Response:**

Maybe Logo 2? I think "easy" should mean simple and uncomplicated, and that one seems the most straightforward. Though Logo 6 could also represent "easy" because it looks friendly and approachable... but I'm worried that might be too casual for handling money? I'm not really certain which is better. Logo 2 feels safe, but maybe that's not the same as "easy"? I don't know, this is harder to decide than I thought.

---

## Q5: DOWNLOAD INTENT

**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Isabella's Response:**

I'm not sure I'd be eager to download any gambling app to be honest... but if I had to choose, maybe Logo 2? It looks the least risky somehow. Logo 4 looks nice, but the shadow makes it seem like it's trying hard to impress me, which makes me wonder what it's hiding. Logo 1 feels too aggressive with that tilt. Logo 2 seems like it would be a responsible app, maybe? Though I could be completely wrong about that. I'd probably research it a lot before downloading regardless of the logo.

## Q6: TOP 3 RANKING

**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning.

**Isabella's Response:**

**1st Place: Logo 2**
I think this one feels the safest and most professional. It's not trying to pressure me or get me overly excited, which I appreciate when I'm already nervous about gambling. The clean design makes me think maybe the company is responsible and legitimate? Though I'm not completely certain. It just feels like the most trustworthy option, or at least the least concerning one.

**2nd Place: Logo 6**
Maybe this one? The friendly, rounded style is less intimidating than the bold, aggressive ones. It doesn't make me feel pressured, which is important when I'm already worried about spending too much. Though I wonder if the friendliness is strategic to make me feel comfortable spending money... I'm not sure. But it does feel approachable, I guess.

**3rd Place: Logo 4**
The shadow effect is nice-looking, I suppose. It seems more premium and professional than some of the others. But I'm hesitant because it feels like it's trying to be impressive, and I'm not sure why it needs to try so hard. Could be a good app, could be compensating for something. I really don't know. It's in third place because it looks quality but makes me uncertain.

## Q7: IMMEDIATE ELIMINATIONS

**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Isabella's Response:**

**Logo 1** - The tilt makes me nervous. It feels aggressive and like it's trying to create urgency or excitement, which worries me when I'm already concerned about gambling responsibly. Maybe some people like that energy, but it makes me uncomfortable. I think I'd avoid it.

**Logo 5** - The thick outline feels too bold and in-your-face. It's shouting at me, and I don't like feeling pressured. When I'm already hesitant about gambling, I don't want a logo that's this aggressive. Makes me think the app would be pushy too, maybe?

**Logo 7** - I can't really tell what this says, and that makes me distrustful. If they're making the logo confusing, what else might be confusing or hidden in the app? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but when it comes to gambling and money, I'd rather avoid anything unclear.

**Logo 3** - I'm not sure about this one... the script style is pretty, but it seems wrong for gambling? It looks like a wedding invitation or something. That disconnect makes me uncomfortable - like maybe they're not being honest about what the app actually is? I could be wrong, but I'd probably eliminate it just to be safe.

I'd only consider Logos 2, 6, and maybe 4, though I have concerns about all of them.
