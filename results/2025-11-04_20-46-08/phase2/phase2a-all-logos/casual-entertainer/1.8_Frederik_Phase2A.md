Logo 4 for sure. When my friends and I scroll through the app store together, the ones with visual effects like that shadow always catch our attention first.

My roommate works in advertising and he's always talking about how dimensional designs perform better in social feeds and ads.

**Frederik's Response:**

I think Logo 2 represents "Play Made Easy" best. When people talk about easy-to-use apps, they usually mean ones with clean, simple designs. Everyone in my friend group complains about apps that are too complicated, and Logo 2 looks like it would be straightforward. My friends who use casino apps say the best ones are the ones that don't overcomplicate things, and this logo has that vibe.

I'd probably download Logo 4. When people in my social circle discover new apps, they usually go for ones that look polished and modern. The shadow effect makes it look like a quality app that people would actually use. Plus, if I'm going to recommend an app to friends or post about it, I want it to have a logo that looks good. Everyone's pretty visual on social media, so appearance matters. Logo 4 seems like something my friends would approve of.

## Q6: TOP 3 RANKING

**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning.

**Frederik's Response:**

**1st Place: Logo 4**
My friends would definitely think this one looks the best. The shadow effect gives it that premium, modern look that everyone talks about wanting in apps. It's the kind of logo that would look great in screenshots when people share wins or talk about the app on social media. People I know who work in design say effects like this make brands feel more established and trustworthy. It's visually interesting without being too complicated, which is what most people seem to prefer.

**2nd Place: Logo 2**
Everyone says clean, simple designs are in right now, and this fits that trend. My network of young professionals would respect this logo because it looks mature and professional. It's not trying too hard, which people appreciate. When we talk about apps in our friend group, people often mention liking the "minimalist" ones, and this would fit that description. It's the safe choice that most people would find acceptable.

**3rd Place: Logo 1**
The tilt gives it personality, which some people in my friend group would like. My more creative friends would probably be into the energy of it. It's bold and stands out, which is good for social sharing. But I know some people who'd find the tilt a bit aggressive, so it's more polarizing than Logos 4 and 2. Still, it has character that people could talk about, which matters when you're choosing an app to recommend to friends.

## Q7: IMMEDIATE ELIMINATIONS

**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Frederik's Response:**

**Logo 7** - None of my friends would understand what this even says. Everyone I showed it to in my head would be confused. People don't want to work to figure out a logo, especially for entertainment apps. My social circle would definitely skip this one in the app store. Too abstract for most people.

**Logo 3 and Logo 6** - These look like logos for wedding planning apps or boutique stores, not gambling. Everyone I know who uses betting apps would find these way too soft and feminine. In my friend group, people want gambling apps to feel either professional or exciting, not like greeting cards. These would be hard to recommend to people without them questioning your judgment.

**Logo 5** - The thick outline feels outdated. People in my network who care about design would say this looks old-fashioned. Everyone's moving toward cleaner looks, and this feels like something from several years ago. My friends who work in tech would probably comment that it looks dated. Not something you'd want to be seen using in social settings.

I'd stick with Logos 4, 2, and 1 - those are the ones people in my circle would actually download and talk about.
