## Q1: OVERALL PREFERENCE

**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Mikkel's Response:**

Logo 4! Oh man, that shadow effect is SO cool! It's got this energy and dimension that just pops off the screen. When I'm looking at apps after my shift at like 3am, this would totally catch my eye. It's got that "let's GO!" vibe, you know? The bold letters with the shadow make it feel exciting and premium. Love it!

---

## Q2: TRUST ASSESSMENT

**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Mikkel's Response:**

Hmm, probably Logo 2 for trust, but honestly trust isn't my biggest priority when I'm just trying to have fun after work! Logo 2 looks professional and clean, like it's a legit company. But Logo 4 also feels trustworthy in a different way - the shadow effect makes it seem solid and established, like it's a real brand. I'd trust both!

---

## Q3: STANDOUT/VISIBILITY

**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Mikkel's Response:**

Logo 4 all the way! That shadow is absolutely killer for grabbing attention. When you're scrolling through the app store, that dimensional pop would make you stop and look. Logo 1 with the tilt is also pretty attention-grabbing - that angle gives it energy! But Logo 4 is the champion here. It's got that "pick me!" quality without being obnoxious. Love that!

---

## Q4: BRAND FIT

**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Mikkel's Response:**

Logo 4! Because "Play Made Easy" should still be exciting, right? The shadow effect makes it fun and engaging while the bold "YES" is super clear and easy to read. It's not complicated - you see it and immediately get it. Logo 2 is easy but maybe TOO plain? Like, where's the excitement? Playing should be fun! Logo 4 nails that balance - easy to understand but still gets you hyped!

---

## Q5: DOWNLOAD INTENT

**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Mikkel's Response:**

Logo 4 for sure! That shadow effect tells me the app is going to be high-quality and exciting. It looks like the kind of app that's going to give me that rush I'm looking for after work. Logo 1 would be my second choice because the tilt is energetic and fun. But Logo 4 has this premium feel that makes me think "okay, this is going to be a good time!" I'd download that immediately.

## Q6: TOP 3 RANKING

**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning.

**Mikkel's Response:**

**1st Place: Logo 4**
This is IT! The shadow effect is absolutely perfect - it gives the logo depth and makes it feel premium and exciting. When I'm buzzing after a shift and looking to play something, this logo would get me pumped. It's bold, it's energetic, it's got visual interest without being too complicated. The shadow makes it pop and feel three-dimensional. Love everything about it!

**2nd Place: Logo 1**
The tilt is awesome! It's got this dynamic energy that says "let's have fun!" The stamp/sticker style is cool and gives it personality. It's not boring - it's got attitude. When you're looking for entertainment, you want something that feels lively, and this delivers! The only reason it's not first is because Logo 4's shadow effect is just that much cooler.

**3rd Place: Logo 5**
The thick outline is bold and makes a statement! It's got presence and feels solid. I like how the boldness conveys confidence - like "YES, this is the app!" It's not subtle, but entertainment shouldn't be subtle! My only issue is it feels a bit heavy compared to Logo 4's more sophisticated shadow. But it's still got good energy!

## Q7: IMMEDIATE ELIMINATIONS

**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Mikkel's Response:**

**Logo 2** - Too plain! It's boring, man. Where's the excitement? When I'm looking for entertainment, I want something that gets me hyped, not something that looks like a corporate memo. It's well-designed, I guess, but it doesn't make me feel anything. Total buzzkill.

**Logo 7** - What even is this? I had to stare at it to figure out what it says. If I can't immediately read it, I'm not interested. Plus, it's too abstract and artsy. I want fun, not a puzzle! This feels like it's trying to be exclusive or fancy, but I just want to play some games!

**Logo 3 and Logo 6** - The script styles are too soft and gentle. They look like logos for a spa or a greeting card company, not a gambling app! Where's the energy? Where's the thrill? These feel like they'd be on an app for meditation or knitting patterns. When I'm looking for excitement after a long shift, these logos are telling me I'm going to fall asleep. No thanks!
