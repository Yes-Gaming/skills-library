## Q1: OVERALL PREFERENCE

**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Andreas's Response:**

Logo 1 really speaks to me. It reminds me of this vintage arcade in Copenhagen I used to photograph - they had all these tilted, bold signs that felt so full of life and energy. There was something honest about it, you know? Like, it wasn't trying to be sleek and modern for the sake of it. The tilt gives it personality, like it's not just another app but something with character. I remember my dad had these old board games with similar bold, stamped aesthetics, and they always felt more genuine than the plastic corporate stuff. This logo has that same authentic energy.

## Q2: TRUST ASSESSMENT

**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Andreas's Response:**

That's interesting because trustworthy means different things, right? Logo 2 looks trustworthy in a corporate, professional way - like it would be a reliable platform. But Logo 1 feels trustworthy in a more human way, if that makes sense. It reminds me of the old betting shops I'd see in working-class neighborhoods when I was traveling through England for a photo project. They weren't fancy, but they were honest and straightforward. The tilt and bold style say "we're not hiding behind minimalism - this is who we are." I think I'd trust Logo 1 more because it feels like there's a real personality behind it, not just a design trend.

## Q3: STANDOUT/VISIBILITY

**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Andreas's Response:**

Logo 1 would definitely catch my eye. It's like when you're looking through your camera viewfinder and something is just slightly off-kilter - that asymmetry draws your attention immediately. I remember doing a street photography series where all the most interesting signs were the ones that broke the grid, that had angles and personality. Logo 4 with the shadow might stand out too, but it feels more calculated, you know? Like it was designed to stand out. Logo 1 stands out because it has character, not because someone ran the "make it pop" filter on it. That authenticity would make me stop scrolling.

## Q4: BRAND FIT

**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Andreas's Response:**

Logo 1 captures "Play Made Easy" in a way that feels genuine. There's this café in Aalborg where they have game nights, and everything is simple and fun without being pretentious. The tilted stamp aesthetic reminds me of that vibe - it's approachable, it's playful, but it's not trying too hard. Logo 2 is "easy" but maybe too easy? It's like... when something is too polished, you wonder if there's actually any soul there. Logo 1 says "yes, let's play!" with that tilt and boldness. It reminds me of saying yes to spontaneous things - there's energy in that angle that suggests fun without complication.

## Q5: DOWNLOAD INTENT

**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Andreas's Response:**

Logo 1 would make me curious. It reminds me of this time I was in Berlin and stumbled into this underground card game night - the poster had this similar bold, tilted aesthetic, and it felt like I was discovering something authentic rather than being marketed to. When I see overly polished logos like some of these others, I think "oh, another corporate app." But Logo 1? It makes me think there might be actual people behind it who care about creating something fun. I'd download it because it feels like there's a story there, not just an algorithm trying to optimize my engagement.

## Q6: TOP 3 RANKING

**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning.

**Andreas's Response:**

**1st Place: Logo 1**
The tilted stamp style reminds me of authentic, unpretentious places that actually care about the experience rather than just the appearance. When I was photographing Copenhagen's independent businesses, the ones with character always had these bold, slightly imperfect designs that felt human. This logo has that quality - it's confident without being corporate, playful without being childish. The tilt creates visual interest that feels deliberate but not calculated. It's like a good photograph where the composition has energy because it breaks the rules just right.

**2nd Place: Logo 2**
I'll give credit where it's due - this is beautifully executed from a design perspective. Clean, modern, professional. It reminds me of the work I'd see in design museums, where everything is perfectly refined. But that's also its limitation - it's gallery-ready but maybe lacks soul? I respect the craft, but I don't feel much emotion looking at it. It's like perfectly composed product photography versus street photography - both have merit, but one feels more alive. Still, the quality is undeniable.

**3rd Place: Logo 4**
The shadow effect creates this interesting dimension that catches the eye. It reminds me of 3D signs I photographed at an old cinema - there's something nostalgic about it. But here's my issue: the shadow feels like a design effect rather than an organic element. When I'm editing photos, I know the difference between natural depth and artificial effects. This feels a bit too "applied" for my taste. Still, there's visual interest here that I appreciate as a photographer.

## Q7: IMMEDIATE ELIMINATIONS

**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Andreas's Response:**

**Logo 7** - It reminds me of those pretentious art galleries where you need a degree to understand what you're looking at. I've photographed a lot of abstract art, and I respect it in that context, but for an app I want to use casually? No thanks. It's like when photographers get too conceptual and forget that images should communicate first, be clever second. This fails the communication test entirely.

**Logo 5** - The thick outline feels like something from 2010. I was looking through my old photography work recently, and this reminds me of design trends that felt bold at the time but now just look dated. There's a heaviness to it that lacks the confidence of restraint. It's shouting when it could be speaking clearly.

**Logo 3 and Logo 6** - These remind me of wedding invitations or artisanal soap packaging I've photographed for clients. They're lovely in that context, but completely wrong here. It's like using the wrong lens for a shot - the script style is beautiful, but it's solving the wrong problem. When I see these, I think of handmade candles, not gambling apps. There's a mismatch between form and function that bothers me as someone who thinks about visual communication for a living.

I'd keep Logos 1, 2, and 4 for further consideration. They at least understand the category they're in, even if they approach it differently.
