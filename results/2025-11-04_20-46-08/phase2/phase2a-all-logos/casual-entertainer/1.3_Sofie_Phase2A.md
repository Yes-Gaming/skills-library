## Q1: OVERALL PREFERENCE

**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Sofie's Response:**

Logo 2. It's the only one that doesn't feel like it's trying to manipulate me. The others all have these design tricks - shadows, tilts, thick outlines - that scream "pick me!" Logo 2 is just... honest. It's not pretending to be something it's not. As a marketing student, I can see through all the psychological tactics in the others, and it's exhausting. Logo 2 feels like it respects my intelligence.

---

## Q2: TRUST ASSESSMENT

**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Sofie's Response:**

Logo 2, but honestly? I don't fully trust any of them because this is gambling. But if I have to choose, Logo 2 at least doesn't have any of the red flags I've learned to spot. Logo 4 with the shadow feels like it's trying to create false depth to seem more "premium" than it is. Logo 1's tilt is a classic attention-grabbing tactic. Logos 3 and 6 are trying too hard to seem "friendly" which makes me suspicious - what are they hiding behind that friendliness? Logo 5's heavy outline feels aggressive, like they're shouting at me. Logo 7 is trying to be exclusive with the abstract design, which in gambling usually means "we're going to make things complicated so you don't notice the house edge." Logo 2 is just... straightforward. That's the closest to trustworthy I'll get here.

## Q3: STANDOUT/VISIBILITY

**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Sofie's Response:**

Logo 4 with the shadow effect would stand out, but that's exactly the problem. It's designed to catch your eye using a visual trick. That's classic dark pattern thinking - grab attention at any cost. In the app store, standing out often correlates with predatory apps that use psychological manipulation. The apps that are actually good don't need to shout. Logo 1 would also stand out with that aggressive tilt, but again, it feels manipulative. Standing out isn't always a good thing if you're standing out for the wrong reasons.

---

## Q4: BRAND FIT

**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Sofie's Response:**

Logo 2, because "easy" shouldn't require visual gymnastics to communicate. If your logo needs a shadow effect or a tilt or thick outlines to convey your message, your message isn't actually easy. Logo 2 is literally the easiest logo to look at and understand. No tricks, no gimmicks. Just "yes" in a clean typeface. That's what easy should be. The others feel like they're trying to convince me it's easy rather than just being easy.

---

## Q5: DOWNLOAD INTENT

**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Sofie's Response:**

Honestly? None of them would make me immediately download because I'm skeptical of gambling apps by default. But if I had to choose, Logo 2 at least doesn't trigger my "this is trying to manipulate me" alarm. When I see Logo 4's shadow or Logo 1's aggressive tilt, my first thought is "what are they compensating for?" Good products don't need flashy logos. Logo 2 suggests the app might actually focus on functionality rather than psychological tricks to keep me playing. But I'd still read every review and check for licensing before downloading.

## Q6: TOP 3 RANKING

**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning.

**Sofie's Response:**

**1st Place: Logo 2**
The only one that doesn't feel manipulative. Clean, straightforward, no psychological tricks. It's not trying to grab my attention with shadows or tilts or false friendliness. As someone studying marketing, I appreciate design that respects the audience's intelligence. This logo says "we're confident enough in our product that we don't need visual gimmicks."

**2nd Place: Logo 7**
I'm conflicted about this one. On one hand, the abstract monogram feels a bit pretentious and exclusive, which can be a manipulation tactic. On the other hand, at least it's not using the obvious tricks. It's trying something different, even if that different thing might be about creating artificial scarcity or exclusivity. I don't love it, but I respect that it's not following the same playbook as Logos 1, 4, and 5.

**3rd Place: Logo 1**
This is my least-bad choice of the remaining options. The tilt is definitely an attention-grabbing tactic, and the stamp aesthetic is trying to create urgency ("limited time! act now!"). But at least it's bold about what it is. Logos 3 and 6 are worse because they're trying to manipulate through false friendliness, and Logo 5 is just aggressive. Logo 1 is manipulative, but it's honest about being loud and energetic.

## Q7: IMMEDIATE ELIMINATIONS

**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Sofie's Response:**

**Logo 3 and Logo 6** - Immediate eliminations. These feel like textbook examples of predatory design masquerading as "friendly." I've studied this in my consumer psychology class - companies use soft, rounded, playful designs to lower your guard and make you feel safe so you'll spend more. The script/cursive style is deliberately chosen to feel personal and trustworthy, but it's a facade. These logos are designed to manipulate through false intimacy. Hard pass.

**Logo 5** - The thick black outline is just visual aggression. It's shouting "YES" at me, which feels like pressure to agree or comply. This is the kind of logo that would be on an app with constant push notifications and dark patterns to keep you engaged. The heaviness of the design mirrors heavy-handed marketing tactics.

**Logo 4** - The shadow effect is trying to create a sense of dimension and premium quality that probably isn't there. It's like when apps use glossy effects to seem more expensive than they are. This feels like compensation - if the app was actually good, why would the logo need visual tricks to seem impressive? The shadow is literally creating a false depth, which feels metaphorically appropriate for gambling apps that hide their odds.

I'd only consider Logo 2 and maybe Logo 7, though I'm skeptical of 7's exclusivity angle.
