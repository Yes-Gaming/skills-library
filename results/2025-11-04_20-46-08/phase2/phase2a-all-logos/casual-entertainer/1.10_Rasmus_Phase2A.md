## Q1: OVERALL PREFERENCE

**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Rasmus's Response:**

Logo 2, no question. It's the most sophisticated and professionally executed option here. Clean, modern, refined - exactly what a premium entertainment platform should look like. The lowercase treatment is confident without being aggressive, and the overall execution demonstrates design maturity. This is the logo of a company that knows what it's doing. Definitely the winner.

## Q2: TRUST ASSESSMENT

**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Rasmus's Response:**

Obviously Logo 2. Professional design signals professional operations. The clean, straightforward aesthetic tells me this company is transparent and confident in their offering. They're not using visual tricks or flashy effects to compensate for anything. This is the mark of a legitimate, trustworthy platform. The others either try too hard or don't try hard enough. Logo 2 gets it exactly right.

## Q3: STANDOUT/VISIBILITY

**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Rasmus's Response:**

Logo 4 would grab attention in the app store with that shadow effect - it's designed for impact. But here's the thing: standing out matters, but standing out with quality matters more. Logo 2 stands out through sophistication. In a sea of aggressive gambling logos, the refinement is actually more distinctive. That said, for pure eye-catching in the first second, Logo 4 wins. But Logo 2 is the one I'd actually click on.

## Q4: BRAND FIT

**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Rasmus's Response:**

Logo 2, hands down. "Play Made Easy" isn't about being simplistic - it's about being effortlessly sophisticated. Logo 2 embodies that perfectly. The clean design suggests an elegant user experience. It's easy because it's well-designed, not because it's dumbed down. Some of these other logos confuse "easy" with "childish" or "basic." Logo 2 understands that ease comes from refinement. Clear winner.

## Q5: DOWNLOAD INTENT

**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Rasmus's Response:**

Definitely Logo 2. I'm not downloading apps with amateur logos - life's too short for poor quality. Logo 2 tells me the product will be premium, the interface will be well-designed, and the company takes itself seriously. That's what I want in entertainment. Logo 4 is second place - it shows effort and has visual interest. But Logo 2 is the one that signals "this is worth your time and money." No question.

## Q6: TOP 3 RANKING

**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning.

**Rasmus's Response:**

**1st Place: Logo 2**
This is professional design at its finest. The refinement and restraint demonstrate confidence and maturity. The lowercase "yes" is approachable without being casual, modern without being trendy. This is the kind of logo that will age well because it's built on solid design principles rather than effects or gimmicks. It signals quality, transparency, and sophistication. For a premium entertainment platform, this is exactly what you want. It's not trying to convince you it's good - it just is. Clear winner.

**2nd Place: Logo 4**
Strong visual impact with the shadow effect. It has presence and creates dimension that catches the eye. This would perform well in marketing contexts where you need immediate attention. My only reservation is that the effect might date the logo over time - trends in visual effects change. But for now, it's well-executed and professional. Solid second place.

**3rd Place: Logo 1**
The bold, tilted aesthetic has energy and personality. It's distinctive and would be memorable. The stamp/sticker style gives it character without being overly decorative. My concern is that the tilt might limit versatility in certain applications, but overall it's a confident design choice. Third place because it's good, but Logos 2 and 4 are better executed.

## Q7: IMMEDIATE ELIMINATIONS

**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Rasmus's Response:**

**Logo 7** - Eliminated immediately. Abstract monograms are fine for luxury fashion brands, but this is a gambling platform. If I can't immediately read your logo, you've failed at basic communication. This is trying too hard to be clever and not hard enough to be clear. Amateur mistake. Out.

**Logo 3 and Logo 6** - Wrong category entirely. These look like logos for wedding planners or bakeries. Completely inappropriate for gambling. The script style undermines any sense of professionalism or trust. If you're this confused about your brand positioning, I don't trust you with my money. Both eliminated.

**Logo 5** - Outdated design. The thick outline was popular a decade ago, but it looks dated now. I want cutting-edge, not yesterday's trends. This tells me the company isn't keeping up with the market. If your logo is behind the times, your platform probably is too. Eliminated.

The only viable options are Logos 2, 4, and 1. Everything else fails basic quality standards.
