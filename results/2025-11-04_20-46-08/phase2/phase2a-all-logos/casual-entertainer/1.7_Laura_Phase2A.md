## Q1: OVERALL PREFERENCE

**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Laura's Response:**

Logo 2. From a practical standpoint, it's the most functional. Clean, readable, and would work well at any size. When I'm on the bus checking my phone, I need to be able to quickly identify apps. This one is instantly recognizable. No unnecessary decoration that might cause rendering issues or make the icon hard to read on smaller screens. It's just efficient design.

---

## Q2: TRUST ASSESSMENT

**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Laura's Response:**

Logo 2. It looks professional and straightforward. When I'm using an app that handles money, I need to trust that it's well-run. A clean, simple logo suggests the company focuses on functionality rather than flashy marketing. The design implies competence. From a usability perspective, trust comes from reliability, and this logo communicates that better than the others.

## Q3: STANDOUT/VISIBILITY

**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Laura's Response:**

Logo 4 would probably stand out more in the app store because of the shadow effect. But functionally speaking, standing out isn't always the priority - being recognizable is. Logo 2 would be easy to spot because it's distinct in its simplicity. When I'm scrolling through my phone on the bus, I can identify Logo 2-style icons quickly. Logo 4 might catch attention initially, but Logo 2 is more practical for repeated use.

## Q4: BRAND FIT

**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Laura's Response:**

Logo 2. "Easy" means no complications, and this logo has no complications. It's straightforward - you look at it, you read it, you understand it. That's easy. The others add visual elements that make them more complex - shadows, tilts, scripts, outlines. Each addition reduces the "easy" factor. From a functional perspective, Logo 2 is the only one that truly embodies simplicity.

## Q5: DOWNLOAD INTENT

**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Laura's Response:**

Logo 2. When I'm evaluating a new app during my commute, I'm looking for signs that it will be user-friendly. A clean logo suggests a clean interface. An overly complicated logo makes me worry the app will be cluttered and frustrating to use. I don't have time for apps that don't work smoothly. Logo 2 tells me this app will be straightforward and functional, which is exactly what I need for quick entertainment between bus stops.

## Q6: TOP 3 RANKING

**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning.

**Laura's Response:**

**1st Place: Logo 2**
Most functional option. Excellent readability at all sizes - critical for mobile use. No unnecessary design elements that could complicate rendering or reduce clarity. The lowercase approach is modern and approachable without sacrificing professionalism. From a usability standpoint, this checks all boxes: clear, scalable, versatile, and professional. Would work equally well as an app icon, in notifications, or in promotional materials. Efficient design.

**2nd Place: Logo 4**
The shadow effect adds visual interest while maintaining readability. More eye-catching than Logo 2, which has practical benefits for initial discovery. My concern is whether the shadow effect scales well to small sizes - might cause legibility issues on notification icons. But overall, it's a functional design that balances impact with clarity. Would need to test at actual icon sizes to confirm usability.

**3rd Place: Logo 1**
The bold treatment ensures readability, which is important. The tilt adds energy, though I worry it might reduce clarity at smaller sizes or create balance issues in certain layouts. Functionally, it works well enough for most applications. My reservation is that the tilt is primarily stylistic rather than functional - it doesn't improve usability, just adds character. But it's still readable and clear, which matters most.

## Q7: IMMEDIATE ELIMINATIONS

**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Laura's Response:**

**Logo 7** - Fails basic readability test. If I can't immediately identify what it says, it's not functional. From a usability perspective, this creates friction. When you're on a crowded bus trying to find an app quickly, you don't have time to decode abstract designs. Eliminated for poor functionality.

**Logo 3 and Logo 6** - The script styles reduce readability, especially at small sizes. Cursive letters can blur together on lower-resolution screens or at small icon sizes. Not practical for mobile apps where clarity is essential. These might work for print materials, but functionally they're poor choices for digital applications. Both eliminated for usability concerns.

**Logo 5** - The thick outline makes it feel heavy and reduces the actual letter visibility. From a design efficiency standpoint, you're using visual weight on the outline rather than on clear letterforms. At small sizes, this would likely create a blocky shape that's harder to read. Not optimal from a functional perspective.

The practical choices are Logos 2, 4, and 1 - all maintain readability and functionality while offering different levels of visual impact.
