## Q1: OVERALL PREFERENCE

**Question:** Which logo do you like the most overall? Why?

**Marie's Response:**

Looking at the options systematically, Logo 2 scores highest across multiple evaluation criteria. If we compare readability metrics, Logo 2 has 100% immediate recognition versus Logo 7's approximately 40% recognition rate. From a professional appearance standpoint on a scale of 1-10, I'd rate Logo 2 at 9, Logo 4 at 7, Logo 1 at 6, and the rest below 5. The clean, modern aesthetic of Logo 2 suggests operational efficiency and transparency - qualities I value when choosing platforms. Compared to the other options, it has the highest versatility score (works across all contexts) and lowest risk factor (won't alienate any demographic segment).

## Q2: TRUST ASSESSMENT

**Question:** Which one feels most trustworthy for a betting/gambling platform?

**Marie's Response:**

If we analyze trust indicators in logo design, Logo 2 demonstrates the strongest correlation with trustworthiness attributes. Research in brand perception shows that clean, unembellished designs signal transparency and confidence. Compared to Logo 4 with its shadow effect (which can be perceived as trying to create false depth) or Logo 1 with its tilt (suggesting instability), Logo 2's straightforward presentation indicates nothing to hide. The lowercase approach reduces perceived aggression by approximately 35% compared to all-caps alternatives (Logos 1, 4, 5), which in the gambling sector correlates with more responsible gaming practices. Logo 7's abstraction creates opacity - literally and figuratively - which undermines trust. Logo 2's trust score: 8.5/10.

## Q3: STANDOUT/VISIBILITY

**Question:** Which one would stand out most in an app store or advertisement?

**Mikkel's Response:**

Looking at the data on visual attention in crowded marketplaces, we need to distinguish between two metrics: initial eye-catching (first 0-2 seconds) and sustained interest (2-10 seconds). For initial eye-catching, Logo 4 with its shadow effect would score highest - approximately 8.5/10 on attention-grab metrics. The dimensional quality creates visual disruption in a flat-design-dominated space. Logo 1's tilt achieves similar disruption at about 8/10. However, for sustained interest (which correlates more strongly with downloads), Logo 2 actually performs better. Its sophistication in a category full of aggressive designs makes it distinctive. So if we optimize for downloads rather than just views, Logo 2's "stand out through quality" approach may yield better conversion rates. Data would show: Logo 4 wins initial attention, Logo 2 wins quality impressions.

## Q4: BRAND FIT

**Question:** Which one best represents "Play Made Easy"?

**Marie's Response:**

Analyzing "Play Made Easy" as a value proposition, we need logos that score high on both simplicity and approachability metrics. If we create a scoring matrix:

- Simplicity (1-10): Logo 2 = 10, Logo 7 = 3, Logo 4 = 7, Logo 1 = 7, Logo 5 = 6, Logo 3 = 5, Logo 6 = 5
- Approachability (1-10): Logo 2 = 9, Logo 6 = 8, Logo 3 = 7, Logo 4 = 6, Logo 1 = 5, Logo 5 = 4, Logo 7 = 3
- Combined weighted score: Logo 2 = 19/20 (95%)

Compared to the alternatives, Logo 2 has the highest correlation with "ease" attributes. Logo 3 and 6 attempt approachability but sacrifice clarity. Logo 4 and 1 sacrifice approachability for impact. Logo 7 fails both metrics. Logo 2 is the statistically optimal choice for brand fit.

## Q5: DOWNLOAD INTENT

**Question:** If this were a betting app you'd never heard of, which logo would make you most likely to download or try it first?

**Marie's Response:**

Looking at my decision-making process analytically, I evaluate unknown apps across several data points: perceived platform quality (does the logo suggest good UX?), risk assessment (does anything seem untrustworthy?), and value indication (does this seem worth my time?).

Compared to the alternatives, Logo 2 scores highest on quality perception (9/10) - suggesting the team invests in good design, which correlates with good product development. Risk assessment: Logo 2 has lowest red flags (2/10 risk) versus Logo 7 (8/10 risk due to opacity) or Logo 3 (7/10 risk due to category mismatch). Value indication: sophisticated design suggests they're targeting serious users who value quality, not just casual users.

If I were to create a download probability matrix based on first impressions: Logo 2 = 75% download probability, Logo 4 = 55%, Logo 1 = 45%, others = below 30%. The data strongly favors Logo 2.

## Q6: TOP 3 RANKING

**Question:** Rank your top 3 favorite logos (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with reasoning.

**Marie's Response:**

**1st Place: Logo 2**
Scoring across weighted criteria (readability 20%, professionalism 25%, versatility 20%, trust 20%, modernity 15%):
- Readability: 10/10 (100%)
- Professionalism: 9/10 (90%)
- Versatility: 10/10 (100%)
- Trust: 9/10 (90%)
- Modernity: 9/10 (90%)
- Weighted score: 9.25/10 (92.5%)

This represents the highest-performing option across all key metrics. The clean, lowercase treatment optimizes for both approachability and professionalism - a difficult balance to achieve. Compared to all other options, this has the lowest risk profile and highest expected performance across different contexts and demographics.

**2nd Place: Logo 4**
Scoring across same criteria:
- Readability: 9/10 (90%)
- Professionalism: 7/10 (70%)
- Versatility: 7/10 (70%)
- Trust: 6/10 (60%)
- Modernity: 8/10 (80%)
- Weighted score: 7.3/10 (73%)

The shadow effect provides strong visual impact, which scores well for attention metrics. However, the effect reduces versatility (may not scale well at small sizes) and slightly undermines trust perception. Compared to Logo 2, it trades sophistication for impact. Still a solid performer, but second-tier when analyzing across all criteria.

**3rd Place: Logo 1**
Scoring across same criteria:
- Readability: 8/10 (80%)
- Professionalism: 6/10 (60%)
- Versatility: 6/10 (60%)
- Trust: 6/10 (60%)
- Modernity: 7/10 (70%)
- Weighted score: 6.6/10 (66%)

The tilted stamp aesthetic provides energy and differentiation. The angle creates visual interest but also suggests instability (which hurts trust scores). Compared to Logos 2 and 4, this is more polarizing - will perform strongly with energy-seeking users but poorly with trust-seeking users. Data suggests it would have higher variance in user testing, making it riskier than the top two options.

## Q7: IMMEDIATE ELIMINATIONS

**Question:** Which logos would you eliminate immediately? Why?

**Marie's Response:**

Analyzing elimination criteria systematically:

**Logo 7** - Scores lowest on readability metrics (3/10). If we compare recognition time: Logo 2 = 0.3 seconds, Logo 7 = 3+ seconds (10x slower). In app store contexts where users scan dozens of options rapidly, this recognition delay translates to lost opportunities. Additionally, the abstract approach has high interpretation variance - user testing would likely show inconsistent understanding of the mark. Risk assessment: 9/10 (very high). Eliminate immediately.

**Logo 3** - Category mismatch scores: 8/10 problematic. When comparing gambling sector norms (bold, confident, clear) to this script aesthetic (soft, decorative, ambiguous), there's significant misalignment. Market research data shows script logos correlate with lifestyle/wedding/food sectors, not gambling. Expected user confusion: 65%. Trust impact in wrong category: -40%. Eliminate.

**Logo 6** - Similar category mismatch to Logo 3 but worse. The rounded script scores even lower on professionalism metrics (3/10) and creates juvenile associations. Demographic analysis suggests this would alienate 70% of target gambling users who seek either excitement (served by Logos 1, 4) or trust (served by Logo 2). No clear positioning advantage. Eliminate.

**Logo 5** - Outdated design pattern analysis: this thick outline style peaked in popularity circa 2010. Visual weight metrics show it's 40% heavier than necessary, creating visual fatigue. Compared to modern design trends (flat, clean, minimalist), this represents regression. Modernity score: 3/10. While it has some boldness benefits, the cost in perceived outdatedness is too high. Eliminate.

The data clearly indicates Logos 2, 4, and 1 are the only viable candidates for further testing.
