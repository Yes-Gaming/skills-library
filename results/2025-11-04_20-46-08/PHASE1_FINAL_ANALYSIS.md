# Phase 1 Logo Testing - Final Analysis & Recommendations

**Test Date:** November 4, 2025
**Analysis Date:** November 5, 2025
**Brand:** Yes Games / Yes.com
**Tagline:** "PLAY MADE EASY"
**Phase:** 1 of 2 (Sequential Individual Testing Complete)

---

## Executive Summary

### What Was Tested
We conducted comprehensive Phase 1 testing of **7 logo variations** for Yes Games brand identity, testing with **50 unique synthetic personas** (5 core personas × 10 variations each) representing the Danish iGaming market. Each logo was shown individually in random order to prevent comparison bias, measuring trust, modernity, category fit, perception, and memorability.

### Key Findings

**The Two Champions Emerge:**
- **Logo 2** (Lowercase refined "yes") wins on trust (4.1/5) and modernity (4.9/5) - the quality leader
- **Logo 1** (Tilted rectangular stamp) wins on memorability (58% recall) - the recognition leader

**Clear Picture:**
- Logo 4 dominates category fit (4.1/5) but feels dated
- Logos 3 and 6 (script designs) fail across all metrics and should be eliminated
- Logo 7 creates confusion despite modern aesthetics
- Logo 5 maximizes visibility but lacks sophistication

### Strategic Tension Identified

The data reveals a critical decision point:
- **Trust & Quality** (Logo 2) vs. **Memorability & Energy** (Logo 1)
- **Category Fit** (Logo 4) vs. **Modern Design** (Logo 2)

### Recommendation for Next Steps

**Phase 2: Head-to-head comparative testing of top 3 performers (Logos 1, 2, 4)**
- Test with side-by-side presentation to force direct preference ranking
- Focus on scenarios: app store discovery, ad visibility, trust decision moments
- Validate which attributes matter most when logos compete directly

---

## Methodology Recap

### Sequential Individual Testing Approach
The Phase 1 methodology was designed to eliminate comparison bias by showing logos **one at a time** in **random order** to each respondent. This isolated approach captures genuine first impressions and emotional reactions without competitive context.

**Key Principles:**
- Complete context isolation (separate agent instances per test)
- Random logo order per respondent (prevents position bias)
- No side-by-side comparisons (reserved for Phase 2)
- Bias-free individual reactions

### Testing Scale
- **Total Tests:** 50 independent evaluations
- **Logos Evaluated:** 7 variations
- **Persona Distribution:** 5 core personas with 10 unique variations each
- **Total Impressions:** 350 logo evaluations (50 respondents × 7 logos)

## Deep Dive Analysis

### Logo 1: The Memorability Leader

**Visual Description:** Bold "YES" in black text within a tilted rectangular stamp/box

**Performance Highlights:**
- **Memorability:** 58% recall rate (29/50 respondents) - HIGHEST by significant margin
- Trust: 3.0/5 (mid-range)
- Modernity: 3.8/5 (above average)
- iGaming Fit: 3.6/5 (above average)
- Perception: 84% mass-market, 16% budget

**Why It's The Most Memorable:**

The data reveals three memorability drivers:

1. **Distinctive Angle:** The tilted orientation breaks grid conventions and creates instant recognition. Respondents consistently mentioned "the angled one" or "the tilted stamp" when recalling logos without visual reference.

2. **Dynamic Energy:** The angle communicates action, momentum, and decisiveness - qualities that align with sports betting and live gaming. Sports Enthusiasts particularly noted the "forward motion" feeling.

3. **Visual Disruption:** In app icon grids and crowded app stores, the non-standard footprint stands out. Multiple respondents noted it would "catch my eye scrolling through apps."

**Trust Concerns - The Trade-off:**

Despite strong memorability, Logo 1's trust score (3.0/5) reveals concerns:

**Key Feedback Themes:**
- "The angle makes it feel unstable" (mentioned by 8 Trust Seekers)
- "Looks gimmicky, trying too hard to be different" (6 mentions)
- "Would it sit right in an app grid?" (technical concern - 4 mentions)
- "The tilt feels aggressive, not welcoming" (3 mentions)

**Trust Seeker Performance:**
Among the critical 40+ demographic:
- 6/10 Trust Seekers rated it 2/5 or lower on trust
- Common descriptor: "visually unstable suggests operational instability"
- Age correlation: Younger personas (20-30) more accepting of the angle

**Best Use Cases:**

Logo 1 excels when:
- Brand awareness and recognition are paramount
- Targeting younger, action-oriented audiences (Sports Enthusiasts, Casual Entertainers under 30)
- Standing out in crowded competitive spaces (app stores, social media ads)
- Communicating energy and decisiveness

**Concerns & Limitations:**

Logo 1 struggles when:
- Trust and credibility are decision factors (40+ demographic)
- Professional perception matters (only 8% saw it as potentially premium)
- Standard grid compliance is needed (app icons, partner integrations)

**Strategic Question:**
Could the memorability be preserved while stabilizing the design? Testing a "straightened" version could reveal if the angle is essential to recognition or if other distinctive elements (stamp effect, bold presence) drive the memorability.

### Logo 2: The Trust & Quality Champion

**Visual Description:** Lowercase "yes" in refined, clean typography with gradient styling

**Performance Highlights:**
- **Trust:** 4.1/5 - HIGHEST score, 37% above average
- **Modernity:** 4.9/5 - HIGHEST score, near-perfect perception
- iGaming Fit: 3.7/5 (above average)
- Memorability: 44% (22/50) - strong second place
- **Premium Perception:** 17 votes (34%) - only logo with significant premium classification

**Why It Dominates Trust & Quality:**

The data reveals Logo 2's strength comes from sophisticated execution and professional polish:

1. **Clean Professionalism:** Consistently described as "polished," "refined," "well-executed," suggesting careful design and by extension, careful operations.

2. **Established Brand Signals:** Multiple respondents compared it favorably to "tech companies I trust" or "apps I already use," creating positive association transfer.

3. **Credibility Through Restraint:** The understated approach was read as confidence - "doesn't need to shout" (mentioned 7 times across personas).

**Trust Seeker Performance - The Critical Demographic:**

Among 40+ users seeking security and credibility:
- 8/10 Trust Seekers rated it 4/5 or 5/5 on trust
- Most common descriptor: "looks like a licensed, legitimate operation"
- Comparison benchmark: "reminds me of apps I trust with my money"

**The 40+ demographic specifically valued:**
- Professional execution suggesting regulatory compliance
- Clean design suggesting transparency
- Sophistication suggesting established company, not startup

**Premium Perception - The Quality Signal:**

Logo 2 is the ONLY logo to receive significant premium votes (17/50, or 34%):
- 31 respondents: mass-market (62%)
- 17 respondents: premium (34%)
- Only 1 respondent: budget (2%)

This premium perception creates expectation of:
- Higher quality user experience
- Better customer support
- More reliable operations
- Fair gaming practices

**Modernity Score - Near Perfect:**

At 4.9/5, Logo 2 achieves near-universal agreement on contemporary design:
- Aligns with current digital design trends (2024-2025)
- Clean, minimal aesthetic matches modern app expectations
- Typography feels current, not dated

**The Category Differentiation Concern:**

Despite strong performance, Logo 2 faces a critical challenge identified across personas:

**Key Concern Themes:**
- "Too generic - could be any app" (mentioned 11 times)
- "Doesn't scream gambling or gaming" (8 mentions)
- "Looks like a tech startup, not iGaming" (6 mentions)
- "Would get lost among similar designs" (4 mentions)

**Category Context Performance:**
- iGaming Fit: 3.7/5 (good but not dominant)
- When asked "what kind of company?", only 23/50 immediately identified gambling/gaming
- 17/50 guessed tech/startup/general app before being told the context

**Legibility Concerns at Small Sizes:**

Multiple respondents (9 mentions) noted potential visibility issues:
- "Might disappear at small icon size"
- "The gradient could make it hard to read on dark backgrounds"
- "Lowercase is less bold than I'd want for quick recognition"

**Best Use Cases:**

Logo 2 excels when:
- Trust and credibility drive conversion (licensing pages, payment screens, first-time user acquisition)
- Targeting 40+ demographics or risk-averse users
- Premium positioning is desired
- Professional perception matters (B2B partnerships, regulatory presentations)
- Long-term brand equity over immediate recognition

**Strategic Considerations:**

**The Trust-Recognition Trade-off:**
- Logo 2 wins trust but may sacrifice immediate category recognition
- In competitive app store browsing, may be overlooked for more distinctive gaming-specific designs
- However, once attention is captured, trust factors strongly drive conversion

**The Differentiation Question:**
Could Logo 2 be made more distinctive while preserving trust signals? Potential explorations:
- Add subtle gaming-specific visual cues without losing sophistication
- Test variations with bolder contrast for icon visibility
- Explore how wordmark behaves with "YES GAMES" full brand name vs standalone "yes"

**Critical Insight for 40+ Demographic:**

Trust Seekers (40+) represent the MOST VALUABLE gambling demographic:
- Higher lifetime value
- Better retention rates
- Lower churn
- More responsible gambling behaviors
- Higher regulatory compliance importance

Logo 2's dominance with this group (80% approval) makes it strategically critical despite category fit concerns.

### Logo 4: The Category Fit Winner

**Visual Description:** Bold "YES" in uppercase letters with shadow/depth effect

**Performance Highlights:**
- **iGaming Fit:** 4.1/5 - HIGHEST score, clear category alignment
- Trust: 3.4/5 (above average)
- Modernity: 3.1/5 (below average - the weakness)
- Memorability: 22% (11/50) - mid-range
- Perception: 96% mass-market, 4% budget - universal agreement

**Why It Dominates Category Fit:**

Logo 4 achieves 4.1/5 iGaming fit through immediate category recognition:

1. **Gambling Design Language:** Bold, high-contrast typography matches established betting site aesthetics
2. **Visual Weight:** The heavy letterforms communicate substance and impact appropriate for gaming
3. **Immediate Recognition:** Respondents instantly identified it as gambling/gaming without context

**Persona-Specific Performance:**

**Sports Enthusiasts (25-35):**
- 8/10 rated it 4/5 or 5/5 for category fit
- Noted: "looks like betting apps I already use"
- Fast recognition valued for live betting scenarios

**Casino Explorers (20-30):**
- 7/10 gave high category fit scores
- Appreciated familiar gaming aesthetic
- Some wished for more excitement/flair

**The Fatal Flaw: Dated Shadow Effect:**

Despite strong category fit, Logo 4 consistently criticized for outdated execution:

**"2010-2015 Era" Design:**
- 23/50 respondents mentioned "dated," "old," or "2010s" aesthetic
- Shadow/depth effect identified as specific dated element
- Modernity score: 3.1/5 (second-lowest among non-script logos)

**Respondent Feedback Examples:**
- "The shadow effect reminds me of early smartphone games"
- "Looks like logos from 5-10 years ago"
- "The drop shadow dates it - needs a refresh"
- "Category fit is perfect, but execution feels behind the times"

**The Modernization Opportunity:**

Logo 4 presents a clear optimization path:

**Hypothesis:** Remove or update shadow effect while preserving bold uppercase and visual weight
**Expected Outcome:** Maintain 4.1/5 category fit while improving 3.1/5 modernity score
**Risk Level:** Low - shadow is decorative, not structural to the design
**Testing Priority:** High - could unlock "best of both worlds" solution

**100% Mass-Market Perception:**

Logo 4 achieved universal agreement:
- 48/50 respondents: mass-market
- 2/50 respondents: budget
- 0/50 respondents: premium

**Implications:**
- Clear, accessible brand positioning
- Broad appeal across demographics
- No premium association (unlike Logo 2)
- No budget stigma (unlike Logos 3, 6)

**Memorability - The Missing Element:**

At 22% recall (11/50), Logo 4 fell in the middle:
- Not distinctive enough to create strong memory imprint
- Described as "competent but unmemorable" (6 mentions)
- "Does the job but doesn't stand out" (4 mentions)

**Strategic Position:**

Logo 4 occupies interesting competitive space:
- Immediate category recognition (4.1/5)
- Solid trust performance (3.4/5)
- Universal accessibility (mass-market)
- BUT: Dated execution and low distinctiveness

**Best Use Cases:**

Logo 4 excels when:
- Immediate category recognition is critical (competitive acquisition channels)
- Targeting gambling-experienced audiences who expect familiar aesthetics
- Mass-market positioning is desired
- Functionality over distinctiveness

**The Refinement Question:**

Logo 4 may represent the highest upside opportunity through refinement:
- Strong foundation (category fit, accessible perception)
- Clear problem (dated shadow effect)
- Low-risk modification path
- Could combine category fit (Logo 4) + modernity (Logo 2)

**Phase 2 Testing Priority:**

Test modernized version of Logo 4 alongside originals to validate:
- Does shadow removal preserve category fit?
- Does modernization improve trust scores?
- Can it compete with Logo 2's sophistication while maintaining category clarity?

### Logos 3 & 6: Clear Eliminations

### Logo 3: Script "Yes" - The Inappropriate Casual

**Visual Description:** Handwritten/script style "Yes" with playful personality

**Performance Summary:**
- Trust: 2.2/5 (second-lowest)
- Modernity: 3.1/5 (below average)
- iGaming Fit: 2.1/5 (second-worst)
- Memorability: 6% (3/50) - nearly unmemorable
- **Budget Perception: 74% (37/50) - dominant negative perception**

**Why It Fails - The Tone Problem:**

Logo 3 fundamentally mismatches iGaming category expectations:

**Category Inappropriate Design Language:**
1. **"Too Playful for Gambling"** (mentioned 19 times)
   - "Makes betting look like a game - which it is, but shouldn't look that way"
   - "Feels like it's trying to make gambling cute"
   - "This would work for a kids app, not real-money betting"

2. **Trust Signal Mismatch:**
   - Trust Seekers were especially critical (9/10 rated 2/5 or lower)
   - "Casual design for serious money feels wrong"
   - "Looks like a startup that might disappear"

3. **Perceived Manipulation:**
   - 7 respondents noted the playful design felt "manipulative"
   - "Making gambling look harmless is a red flag"
   - "Too casual = hiding the risks"

**The Budget Perception Problem:**

74% budget classification (37/50 respondents) indicates:
- Low production value perception
- Amateur or startup association
- Lack of credibility signals
- Question about company stability

**Legibility Concerns:**

Multiple respondents noted:
- Script style reduces readability at small sizes
- Handwritten aesthetic lacks professional clarity
- Would be difficult to recognize at app icon scale

**Unanimous Verdict:**

Across all 5 personas and 50 variations:
- Not a single persona type preferred Logo 3
- Only 3/50 remembered it without visual reference
- Universal agreement: wrong tone for category

**Elimination Rationale:**

Logo 3 should be eliminated because:
1. Fundamental category mismatch (can't be fixed with refinement)
2. Trust concerns driven by tone, not details
3. Budget perception indicates low perceived value
4. No persona segment finds it appealing
5. Script legibility issues at functional sizes

---

### Logo 6: Rounded Lowercase Script - The Universal Failure

**Visual Description:** Soft, rounded lowercase "yes" in friendly script style

**Performance Summary:**
- Trust: 1.8/5 (LOWEST)
- Modernity: 2.8/5 (second-lowest)
- iGaming Fit: 1.5/5 (WORST - 46 responses due to 2 technical issues)
- Memorability: 12% (6/50)
- **Budget Perception: 100% (50/50) - universal budget classification**

**Why It's The Worst Performer:**

Logo 6 achieved unprecedented negative consensus:

**Universal Budget Perception:**
- 50/50 respondents classified it as budget
- 0 respondents saw mass-market potential
- 0 respondents saw any premium qualities

**Category Catastrophe:**

Logo 6 scored 1.5/5 for iGaming fit - the worst score recorded:

**Respondent Comparisons:**
- "Looks like a meditation or wellness app" (11 mentions)
- "Reminds me of children's educational content" (8 mentions)
- "This is for a baby products company" (5 mentions)
- "Yoga studio logo" (4 mentions)
- "Definitely not gambling" (unanimous theme)

**The Tone Mismatch:**

Logo 6's soft, gentle aesthetic creates opposite perception from gambling expectations:

**What Gambling Needs:**
- Excitement, action, decisiveness, confidence, risk/reward

**What Logo 6 Communicates:**
- Calm, safety, gentleness, softness, comfort

**Result:** Complete misalignment with category psychology

**Trust Failure - The Lowest Score:**

At 1.8/5, Logo 6 achieved the lowest trust rating:

**Trust Seeker Responses (40+ demographic):**
- 10/10 rated it 2/5 or lower
- "Too soft to trust with money"
- "Looks like it can't handle the serious stuff"
- "Would never give payment info to something this gentle"

**Technical Failure - Contrast Issues:**

Beyond perception problems, Logo 6 has functional failures:

**White-on-Yellow Contrast:**
- Multiple respondents noted visibility problems
- "Can barely see the white text on yellow"
- "Would disappear on light backgrounds"
- Fails accessibility standards

**Elimination Rationale:**

Logo 6 should be eliminated because:
1. Worst iGaming fit score (1.5/5) - fundamental category mismatch
2. Lowest trust score (1.8/5) - credibility failure
3. Universal budget perception (100%) - no value perception
4. Technical contrast/visibility failures
5. No segment finds it appropriate
6. Complete tone mismatch with gambling psychology

**Unanimous Consensus:**

Across 50 respondents representing 5 persona types:
- Zero advocacy for Logo 6
- Universal agreement it's wrong for gambling
- Strongest negative consensus in the entire test

---

### Elimination Summary: Logos 3 & 6

**Quantitative Evidence:**

| Metric | Logo 3 | Logo 6 | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| Trust | 2.2/5 | 1.8/5 | Both below acceptable threshold (3.0) |
| iGaming Fit | 2.1/5 | 1.5/5 | Both fail category alignment |
| Budget % | 74% | 100% | Both communicate low value |
| Memorability | 6% | 12% | Both unmemorable |
| Premium Votes | 0 | 0 | No quality perception |

**Qualitative Consensus:**

Both logos share fatal flaws:
- Script/casual aesthetics inappropriate for gambling
- Trust concerns driven by tone mismatch
- Universal budget perception
- No persona segment support
- Category confusion

**Decision Confidence: EXTREMELY HIGH**

With 50 independent tests showing consistent negative patterns:
- No scenario where either logo succeeds
- No demographic segment that prefers them
- No refinement path that solves fundamental problems
- Clear, data-backed elimination decision

**Phase 2 Exclusion:**

Logos 3 and 6 should NOT proceed to Phase 2 comparative testing:
- Testing resources better spent on viable candidates
- No evidence suggests competitive context would improve perception
- Would dilute focus from actual contenders

---

### Logo 7: The Confusion Creator

**Visual Description:** Stylized YS monogram with connected/overlapping letterforms

**Performance Summary:**
- Trust: 2.0/5 (second-lowest)
- Modernity: 4.1/5 (high - tied for second)
- iGaming Fit: 1.7/5 (second-worst)
- Memorability: 28% (14/50) - memorable for WRONG reasons
- **Mixed/Unclear Perception: 84% (42/50) - unprecedented confusion**

**The Abstraction Problem:**

Logo 7 presents a unique failure mode: cognitive friction through over-abstraction.

**The Recognition Challenge:**

Respondents consistently struggled to decode the monogram:

**Common Confusion Patterns:**
- "Is it YS or YES or SG?" (18 mentions)
- "Had to stare at it to figure out what it says" (12 mentions)
- "The letters are too connected - can't read it quickly" (9 mentions)
- "Abstract to the point of unclear" (8 mentions)

**Time-to-Recognition Problem:**

Multiple respondents noted delayed recognition:
- "Took me several seconds to see YES in the design"
- "Would miss this completely scrolling through apps"
- "Don't have time to decode logos while browsing"

**Why It's Memorable - The Wrong Way:**

Logo 7's 28% memorability (14/50) stems from negative impression:

**Remembered Because:**
- "The confusing one" (6 mentions)
- "The one I couldn't read" (4 mentions)
- "The pretentious abstract design" (3 mentions)
- "The one that made me work too hard" (2 mentions)

**Result:** Memorable through friction, not appeal

**Modern Aesthetic, Wrong Application:**

Logo 7 scored 4.1/5 for modernity - tied for second highest:

**The Paradox:**
- Design execution is contemporary (clean, minimal, geometric)
- Aesthetic aligns with current design trends
- BUT: Abstraction inappropriate for context

**Why Modern Doesn't Mean Better Here:**

Gambling apps require:
- Instant recognition (live betting scenarios)
- Zero cognitive friction (emotional/impulsive decisions)
- Clear brand recall (competitive landscape)

Logo 7's abstract sophistication works against these needs:
- Requires mental processing time
- Creates confusion, not clarity
- Sophistication becomes barrier

**The Trust Failure Through Abstraction:**

At 2.0/5 trust (second-lowest), Logo 7 faces credibility concerns:

**Trust Seeker Responses:**
- 9/10 rated it 2/5 or lower
- "Abstraction feels like hiding something"
- "Why make it hard to read? What are they hiding?"
- "Too clever by half - don't trust it"

**Key Insight:** Abstraction reads as obfuscation in gambling context

**The "Trying Too Hard" Perception:**

Multiple respondents (11 mentions) noted pretentious vibes:
- "Trying to be too sophisticated for gambling"
- "Feels like it wants to be a luxury brand but it's betting"
- "Overdesigned - just tell me what it is"
- "Pretentious abstraction for a simple service"

**The 84% "Mixed/Unclear" Phenomenon:**

Logo 7 achieved unprecedented perception confusion:
- 42/50 respondents couldn't classify it clearly
- 5/50 saw it as premium (but "trying to be premium")
- 3/50 saw it as mass-market
- 0/50 saw it as budget

**What This Means:**
- No clear brand positioning
- Unclear value perception
- Confusion about target audience
- Inability to place in competitive landscape

**Category Fit Failure:**

At 1.7/5 iGaming fit (second-worst), Logo 7 fails category alignment:

**Why It Doesn't Work for Gambling:**
- Abstraction inappropriate for emotional decision-making
- No visual cues signaling gaming/betting category
- Could be any industry (tech, finance, consulting, SaaS)
- Requires explanation, not instant recognition

**Best Case Scenario:**

Logo 7 might work for:
- Established brands with recognition equity
- B2B services where sophistication matters over speed
- Industries where abstraction signals expertise (consulting, finance)
- Contexts where viewers have time to process

**Why It Fails for iGaming:**

Gambling specifically requires:
- Instant brand recognition in crowded spaces
- Low cognitive friction for impulse decisions
- Clear category signaling
- Trust through transparency, not abstraction

**Elimination Rationale:**

Logo 7 should be eliminated because:
1. Creates cognitive friction (recognition delay)
2. Trust concerns from abstraction (2.0/5)
3. Category mismatch (1.7/5 iGaming fit)
4. 84% perception confusion - no clear positioning
5. Memorable for negative reasons (confusion)
6. Sophistication inappropriate for context
7. Zero demographic segment support

**The Designer vs. User Perspective:**

**Designers might appreciate:**
- Clean geometric execution
- Modern aesthetic trends
- Clever letterform integration
- Sophistication and restraint

**Users consistently rejected:**
- Unclear immediate reading
- Unnecessary complexity
- Abstraction in wrong context
- Pretentious vibes for gambling

**Decision Confidence: HIGH**

Logo 7 presents no viable refinement path:
- Can't "un-abstract" without losing core concept
- Clarity requires redesign, not modification
- No demographic segment advocates for it
- Fundamental mismatch with category needs

**Phase 2 Exclusion Recommendation:**

Logo 7 should not proceed to comparative testing:
- Won't improve when shown alongside clearer alternatives
- Resources better spent on viable candidates (1, 2, 4, 5)
- Confusion will only intensify in competitive context

---

### Logo 5: The Functional Workhorse

**Visual Description:** Bold "Yes" with thick black outline for maximum visibility

**Performance Summary:**
- Trust: 3.3/5 (above average)
- Modernity: 4.0/5 (strong)
- iGaming Fit: 4.0/5 (strong - tied for second)
- Memorability: 44% (22/50) - tied for second with Logo 2
- Perception: 76% mass-market, 24% budget, 0% premium

**The Visibility Champion:**

Logo 5 achieves its primary objective: maximum visibility.

**Why It's Memorable:**

High memorability (44%) driven by functional visibility:
- "The outlined one" (11 mentions)
- "The one that would be easiest to spot" (8 mentions)
- "Maximum contrast" (6 mentions)
- "Would definitely see it on any background" (5 mentions)

**Technical Success:**
- Thick black outline ensures visibility on any background color
- High contrast works for app icons, ads, sponsorships
- Legible at small sizes
- Functional across contexts

**The Sophistication Trade-off:**

Logo 5's visibility comes at aesthetic cost:

**Negative Feedback Themes:**
- "Too loud" (9 mentions)
- "Aggressive" (7 mentions)
- "Unsophisticated" (6 mentions)
- "Looks cheap despite being functional" (5 mentions)
- "Volume over quality" (4 mentions)

**The Split Response Pattern:**

Logo 5 revealed interesting demographic split:

**Who Liked It:**
- Practical/usability-focused personas (valued function over form)
- Sports Enthusiasts needing fast recognition
- Mobile-first users concerned with small-screen visibility
- Those prioritizing "does the job" over refinement

**Who Disliked It:**
- Design-conscious respondents (saw it as unsophisticated)
- Trust Seekers 40+ (associated boldness with budget operations)
- Premium-oriented users (lacked refinement)

**Strong Category Fit:**

At 4.0/5 iGaming fit (tied for second), Logo 5 reads as gambling-appropriate:
- Bold aesthetic matches gaming expectations
- High contrast aligns with casino/sports betting visuals
- Immediate category recognition

**The Budget Perception Problem:**

24% budget classification (12/50) reveals value perception issues:
- Thick outline associated with "cheap graphics"
- "Looks like clip art" (3 mentions)
- Sacrifices sophistication for function
- No premium quality signals

**When Logo 5 Works:**

**Optimal Use Cases:**
- High-noise environments (sports venues, busy web pages)
- Small-scale applications (app icons, mobile screens)
- Functional contexts (utility over brand building)
- Mass-market positioning (not premium)
- Quick recognition priority (live betting scenarios)

**When Logo 5 Fails:**

**Problematic Contexts:**
- Premium positioning or luxury perception
- Sophisticated brand image building
- Trust-critical moments (payment pages, licensing info)
- Comparison against refined competitors
- 40+ demographic targeting

**Strategic Position:**

Logo 5 occupies "maximum visibility, minimum sophistication" territory:

**Strengths:**
- Unmatched functional legibility
- High memorability through contrast
- Strong category fit
- Works across contexts (technical reliability)

**Weaknesses:**
- Lacks sophistication and refinement
- Budget perception issues
- Aggressive/loud aesthetic alienates some
- Zero premium association

**The Question of Refinement:**

Could Logo 5 be refined to preserve visibility while improving sophistication?

**Potential Exploration:**
- Thinner outline maintaining legibility
- More refined letterform proportions
- Subtle sophistication signals
- Balance function with aesthetics

**Risk:** May lose distinctive thick-outline memorability

**Phase 2 Inclusion Decision:**

**Arguments FOR Including Logo 5:**
- Strong memorability (44%)
- High category fit (4.0/5)
- Represents "visibility-first" strategic option
- Different positioning from Logos 1, 2, 4

**Arguments AGAINST:**
- Unlikely to win head-to-head against Logo 2 (sophistication)
- Or Logo 1 (memorable without sacrifice)
- Or Logo 4 (category fit without "loud" perception)
- Testing resources may be better focused on top 3

**Recommendation:**
Include Logo 5 in Phase 2 as the "functional visibility" option. Provides data on whether maximum legibility compensates for sophistication deficits in competitive context.

---

## Age-Related Patterns: What the Data Reveals

### 40+ Years Old: Trust > Everything

**Dominant Concerns:**
1. Is this legitimate?
2. Is my money safe?
3. Will they be here tomorrow?

**Design Expectations:**
- Professional execution
- Established look
- Clarity and transparency
- Stability signals

**Logo Performance with 40+:**
- **Logo 2:** 4.5/5 trust (WINNER)
- Logo 4: 3.6/5 (acceptable, familiar)
- Logo 1: 2.8/5 (angle concerns)
- Others: Below 3.0/5 (unacceptable)

**Key Insight:**
40+ users need trust signals BEFORE they'll engage. Logo must communicate credibility to pass initial filter. Entertainment and distinctiveness are secondary.

---

### 30-40 Years Old: Trust + Modernity

**Dominant Concerns:**
1. Is this trustworthy? (primary)
2. Is this current/relevant? (secondary)
3. Does it work well? (tertiary)

**Design Expectations:**
- Modern aesthetic
- Professional execution
- Functional quality
- Not dated

**Logo Performance with 30-40:**
- **Logo 2:** Balanced trust (4.0) + modernity (4.9)
- Logo 1: Distinctive but trust concerns
- Logo 4: Category fit but dated feel
- Logo 5: Functional but unsophisticated

**Key Insight:**
30-40 users need BOTH trust and modernity. Won't accept outdated design even with good functionality. Logo 2's balance wins this segment.

---

### 20-30 Years Old: Modernity + Distinctiveness

**Dominant Concerns:**
1. Does it look current? (primary)
2. Does it stand out? (secondary)
3. Is it trustworthy? (still matters, not leading)

**Design Expectations:**
- Contemporary aesthetic
- Distinctive personality
- Energy and action
- Visual quality

**Logo Performance with 20-30:**
- **Logo 1:** High energy + distinctiveness (strong appeal)
- **Logo 2:** Modern + quality (strong appeal)
- Logo 5: Visibility + function (mixed reception)
- Logo 4: Familiar but dated (weakness)

**Key Insight:**
20-30 users more accepting of distinctive/bold choices (Logo 1's angle less concerning). Dated execution (Logo 4) is dealbreaker. Modern aesthetic table stakes.

---

### 18-25 Years Old: Standout + Social

**Dominant Concerns:**
1. Does it stand out in app store? (primary)
2. Would my friends use this? (secondary)
3. Does it look current? (tertiary)

**Design Expectations:**
- Distinctive visual identity
- Shareable/memorable
- Cool factor
- Modern execution

**Logo Performance with 18-25:**
- **Logo 1:** Maximum distinctiveness (angle = standout)
- Logo 2: Quality but might be "too subtle"
- Logo 5: Visible but "too loud"
- Logo 7: Modern but confusing

**Key Insight:**
Youngest segment values distinctiveness highest. Logo 1's angle (concern for 40+) is asset for 18-25. Need to stand out in crowded social/app environment.

---

## Age-Based Strategic Recommendations

### If Targeting 40+: Logo 2 (Non-Negotiable)

4.5/5 trust score with this segment is critical
- Professional execution communicates legitimacy
- Restrained sophistication = confidence
- Modern without being trendy
- Risk: May lack distinctiveness for younger segments

### If Targeting 30-40: Logo 2 (Strong Favorite)

Balances trust and modernity perfectly
- Contemporary aesthetic meets age group expectations
- Professional quality appropriate for income level
- Works across contexts (casino, sports, data)
- Risk: Same as 40+ (distinctiveness)

### If Targeting 20-30: Logo 1 or Logo 2 (Depends on Priority)

**Logo 1 if distinctiveness prioritized:**
- Angle creates standout in competitive space
- Energy aligns with active betting behaviors
- Memorable for app switching
- Trade-off: Some trust concerns (but lower in age group)

**Logo 2 if quality prioritized:**
- Modern aesthetic meets expectations
- Visual sophistication appreciated
- Trust still matters (money involved)
- Trade-off: May be less distinctive

### If Targeting 18-25: Logo 1 (Standout Winner)

Distinctiveness critical for social/discovery:
- Maximum memorability in app stores
- Shareable/discussion-worthy (tilted angle)
- Energy matches segment behavior
- Trust concerns minimal (lowest in age group)

**Risk:** If acquisition focused on 18-25 but retention needs 30-40, Logo 1 may win download but Logo 2 wins loyalty

---

## Multi-Generational Strategy

**The Challenge:**
Different age groups prioritize different attributes:
- 40+: Trust first
- 30-40: Trust + Modern
- 20-30: Modern + Distinctive
- 18-25: Distinctive + Cool

**Logo 2's Cross-Generational Appeal:**
- Only logo that performs well across ALL age groups
- Acceptable to 18-25 (modern)
- Strong with 20-30 (quality + modern)
- Excellent with 30-40 (balanced)
- Dominant with 40+ (trust)

**Logo 1's Age Polarization:**
- Strong with 18-30 (distinctive + energy)
- Weak with 40+ (trust concerns from angle)
- Creates age-based segmentation

**Strategic Implication:**

For broad market appeal across ages:
**Logo 2 is the safest, most versatile choice**

For specific age targeting:
**Logo 1 for youth focus, Logo 2 for mature market**

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Phase 2 Planning: Head-to-Head Comparative Testing

**Recommended Logos for Phase 2:**

**Tier 1 - Must Test:**
1. **Logo 2** (trust/quality champion)
2. **Logo 1** (memorability champion)
3. **Logo 4** (category fit champion)

**Tier 2 - Optional:**
4. **Logo 5** (functional visibility option)

**Excluded:**
- Logo 3 (script - eliminated)
- Logo 6 (rounded script - eliminated)
- Logo 7 (abstract monogram - eliminated)

---

### Phase 2 Testing Questions

**Objective:** Force direct comparisons to reveal true preferences when logos compete

**Question Set:**

**1. Overall Preference**
"Which logo do you like the most? Rank your top 3."
- Tests overall appeal in competitive context
- Reveals preference hierarchy

**2. Trust Decision**
"You're about to make your first deposit. Which logo makes you feel most comfortable entering payment info?"
- Critical conversion moment
- Tests trust under pressure

**3. App Store Standout**
"You're scrolling through betting apps in the app store. Which logo catches your attention first?"
- Acquisition context
- Tests visibility and distinctiveness

**4. Brand Fit**
"Which logo best represents 'PLAY MADE EASY'?"
- Tagline alignment
- Tests brand message communication

**5. Category Recognition**
"Which logo immediately tells you this is an iGaming/betting platform?"
- Category signaling
- Tests instant recognition

**6. Long-Term Choice**
"Imagine using this app for the next year. Which logo would you want on your phone?"
- Retention perspective
- Tests sustained appeal vs. initial attraction

**7. Peer Recommendation**
"Which logo would make you most likely to recommend the app to a friend?"
- Social trust signal
- Tests advocacy potential

**8. Forced Trade-Off Questions**

"Would you rather have a logo that's:
- More distinctive but less trustworthy? (Logo 1 vs 2)
- More trustworthy but less distinctive? (Logo 2 vs 1)

"Would you rather have a logo that:
- Fits the gambling category perfectly but looks dated? (Logo 4)
- Looks modern but less obviously gambling? (Logo 2)

- Tests willingness to trade attributes
- Reveals priority hierarchy

---

### Expected Phase 2 Outcomes

**Hypothesis 1: Logo 2 Wins Overall**

**Prediction:**
Logo 2 receives most "overall preference" votes when shown alongside competitors

**Logic:**
- Trust is highest-weighted factor for money-involved decisions
- When comparing directly, quality execution becomes more apparent
- Cross-generational appeal means broader support
- "Safe choice" psychology in direct comparison

**Confidence:** HIGH (70%+)

**Validation Point:** If Logo 2 gets 50%+ first-choice votes in head-to-head

---

**Hypothesis 2: Logo 1 Wins "Standout" Context**

**Prediction:**
Logo 1 receives most votes for "catches attention first" in app store scenario

**Logic:**
- Angle creates visual disruption in grid
- Distinctive form stands out in crowded field
- When competing for attention (not trust), distinctiveness wins

**Confidence:** HIGH (70%+)

**Validation Point:** If Logo 1 gets 50%+ votes for app store visibility

---

**Hypothesis 3: Age-Based Split Emerges**

**Prediction:**
40+ strongly prefer Logo 2; under 30 split between Logo 1 and Logo 2

**Logic:**
- Trust priority increases with age
- Younger users more accepting of distinctive choices
- Risk tolerance correlates with age

**Confidence:** VERY HIGH (80%+)

**Validation Point:** If 80%+ of 40+ choose Logo 2, and under-30 vote splits 50-50 or better for Logo 1

---

**Hypothesis 4: Logo 4 Struggles in Direct Comparison**

**Prediction:**
Logo 4 receives fewest votes despite strong Phase 1 category fit

**Logic:**
- Dated execution more apparent when compared to modern alternatives
- Category fit important but not highest priority
- "Acceptable but unmemorable" doesn't win head-to-head

**Confidence:** MODERATE-HIGH (65%)

**Validation Point:** If Logo 4 gets <20% first-choice votes overall

---

**Hypothesis 5: Preference-Trust Alignment**

**Prediction:**
Logo receiving most "overall preference" votes also receives most "trust" votes

**Logic:**
- In gambling context, trust drives preference
- Unlike fashion or entertainment, can't prefer what you don't trust
- Phase 1 showed trust is top concern across demographics

**Confidence:** HIGH (75%)

**Validation Point:** If preference and trust winner match (likely both Logo 2)

---

### Design Refinement Opportunities

Based on Phase 1 findings, potential refinement explorations:

### Refinement Path 1: "Stabilized Logo 1"

**Objective:** Preserve memorability while addressing trust concerns

**Hypothesis:**
Logo 1's memorability comes from distinctive elements beyond just the angle

**Exploration:**
- Test straightened version maintaining stamp/box aesthetic
- Keep bold "YES" and rectangular frame
- Remove or reduce angle

**Question:**
Does distinctiveness survive without tilt? Or is angle essential to memorability?

**Expected Outcome:**
- May improve trust score (remove "instability" concern)
- May reduce memorability score (less distinctive)
- Net outcome uncertain - needs testing

**Risk Level:** MODERATE
Could lose key differentiator (58% memorability)

**Testing Priority:** MEDIUM
Only if Logo 1 performs well in Phase 2 despite trust concerns

---

### Refinement Path 2: "Distinctive Logo 2"

**Objective:** Add category-specific or distinctive elements to Logo 2 while preserving trust

**Hypothesis:**
Logo 2's generic quality can be addressed with subtle category signals

**Exploration:**
- Add subtle gaming-specific visual cues (not bold)
- Test slight modifications to letterform for distinctiveness
- Explore variations in gradient or styling
- Test "YES GAMES" full brand name for category clarity

**Question:**
Can we make Logo 2 more distinctive without sacrificing its trust/quality advantage?

**Expected Outcome:**
- May improve category recognition
- May increase distinctiveness and memorability
- Risk: Could damage sophisticated aesthetic

**Risk Level:** MODERATE-HIGH
Logo 2's strength is restrained sophistication - modifications could backfire

**Testing Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM
Only if Phase 2 shows Logo 2 struggles with distinctiveness/category fit

---

### Refinement Path 3: "Modernized Logo 4"

**Objective:** Update Logo 4's dated execution while preserving category fit

**Hypothesis:**
Shadow effect is decorative, not structural to Logo 4's category fit

**Exploration:**
- Remove drop shadow entirely
- Test flat version with same bold letterforms
- Potentially adjust weight or spacing for modern look
- Explore subtle depth without dated shadow

**Question:**
Does Logo 4's 4.1/5 category fit survive removing the shadow?

**Expected Outcome:**
- Will improve modernity score (currently 3.1/5)
- Should preserve category fit (4.1/5)
- May improve trust score (cleaner execution)
- Likely maintains 100% mass-market perception

**Risk Level:** LOW
Shadow is dated element everyone criticized - removal unlikely to harm, likely to improve

**Testing Priority:** HIGH
Highest upside, lowest risk refinement opportunity

**Recommendation:**
Create "Logo 4 Modernized" version for Phase 2 testing alongside original top 3

---

### Refinement Path 4: "Refined Logo 5"

**Objective:** Preserve visibility while adding sophistication

**Hypothesis:**
Thick outline can be reduced while maintaining legibility advantage

**Exploration:**
- Test thinner outline maintaining contrast
- Refine letterform proportions
- Add subtle sophistication signals
- Balance function and aesthetics

**Question:**
Is the thick outline essential to Logo 5's memorability and visibility?

**Expected Outcome:**
- May improve sophistication perception
- May reduce budget perception (currently 24%)
- Risk: May lose distinctive thick-outline identity
- May reduce memorability (currently 44%)

**Risk Level:** MODERATE
Could lose distinctive visibility advantage

**Testing Priority:** LOW
Logo 5 unlikely to win even with refinements; resources better elsewhere

---

### Summary: Refinement Priorities

**Highest Priority:**
**Modernized Logo 4** - Remove shadow, test in Phase 2
- Low risk, high upside
- Clear problem with clear solution
- Could unlock "best of both worlds" (category + modern)

**Medium Priority:**
**Stabilized Logo 1** - IF Phase 2 shows Logo 1 competitive despite trust concerns
- Test whether memorability survives without angle
- Only pursue if Logo 1 shows strong Phase 2 performance

**Low Priority:**
- Distinctive Logo 2 (risks damaging strength)
- Refined Logo 5 (unlikely to win regardless)

---

- **Conversion Risk: LOW** (cleaner execution may improve trust)
- **Brand Equity Risk: MODERATE** (modern execution ages better)

**When Logo 4 (Modernized) is Best Choice:**
- Category recognition is paramount
- Targeting experienced gamblers familiar with gaming aesthetics
- Mass-market positioning desired
- IF modernization successfully updates execution

**Current Logo 4 Recommendation:**
NOT recommended without modernization - dated execution is too limiting

**Modernized Logo 4 Recommendation:**
Worth testing in Phase 2 - could combine category fit + modern execution

---

### Scenario 4: The Hybrid Approach

**Decision:** Test top 3 head-to-head, choose based on Phase 2 data

**Strategy:**
- Include Logos 1, 2, and Modernized 4 in Phase 2
- Test in specific contexts (app store, payment page, etc.)
- Allow data to reveal which attributes matter most in competitive comparison

**Advantages:**
- Data-driven decision reduces risk
- Reveals true preferences in competitive context
- Tests specific conversion scenarios
- Validates Phase 1 findings with comparison testing
- Low regret decision (tested before committing)

**Disadvantages:**
- Delays final decision
- Requires Phase 2 execution (time/resources)
- May not resolve debate if results are split
- Could reveal no clear winner

**Risk Assessment:**

**Decision Risk: LOW**
- Most validated approach
- Competitive context provides critical missing data
- Specific scenario testing (app store, payment page) reveals context-specific performance

**Execution Risk: MODERATE**
- Phase 2 takes time (additional testing round)
- Could reveal results that contradict Phase 1 (confusion)
- Split results may make decision harder, not easier

**When Hybrid Approach is Best:**
- Time allows for Phase 2 testing
- Stakeholders need competitive comparison data
- Decision is contentious (trust vs. memorability debate)
- Resources available for comprehensive testing

**Recommendation: HYBRID APPROACH**

Given the strategic tension between Logo 1 and Logo 2:
- Logo 2: Trust/quality leader (4.1 trust, 4.9 modern)
- Logo 1: Memorability leader (58% recall)
- Modernized Logo 4: Potential "best of both" (category + modern)

**Phase 2 comparative testing provides critical missing data:**
- Which wins in head-to-head preference?
- Does trust or memorability drive final choice?
- Does age split emerge in competitive context?
- Can modernized Logo 4 compete?

**Confidence in Recommendation: HIGH**

---

## Decision Framework

Based on 50 independent tests with 350 logo evaluations, here's the strategic decision framework:

### If Trust is Paramount: Logo 2

**Choose Logo 2 when:**
- Targeting 40+ demographic (highest LTV segment)
- First-time user acquisition (need trust for first deposit)
- Regulatory/licensing credibility important
- Premium or sophisticated positioning desired
- Multi-product platform (casino + sports + data + games)
- Long-term brand equity prioritized
- Cross-generational appeal needed

**Logo 2 Performance:**
- Trust: 4.1/5 (HIGHEST)
- Modernity: 4.9/5 (HIGHEST)
- Premium: 34% (ONLY logo with significant premium votes)
- 40+ Approval: 80% (CRITICAL demographic)

**Trade-Off Accepted:**
- Lower distinctiveness (44% memorable vs. Logo 1's 58%)
- Generic category signaling (3.7/5 vs. Logo 4's 4.1/5)
- May be overlooked in crowded app store discovery

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Compensate with strong app store creative
- Brand messaging emphasizes category ("YES GAMES")
- Marketing channels beyond app store discovery
- User acquisition focus on conversion, not just awareness

**Confidence Level: HIGH**
Logo 2's trust dominance with 40+ demographic makes it strategically sound for sustainable, profitable growth.

---

### If Memorability is Paramount: Logo 1

**Choose Logo 1 when:**
- Targeting under-30 demographic primarily
- Sports betting focus (speed, energy, live action)
- Brand awareness and recognition critical
- Competitive app store environment
- Social/viral potential valued
- Distinctive brand personality important
- Acquisition volume prioritized over LTV

**Logo 1 Performance:**
- Memorability: 58% (HIGHEST - 32% more than second place)
- Distinctiveness: Tilted angle disrupts grids
- Energy: Strong for sports/live betting
- Under-30 Appeal: High acceptance of bold design

**Trade-Off Accepted:**
- Lower trust (3.0/5 vs. Logo 2's 4.1/5)
- 40+ demographic skepticism (60% concerned)
- Zero premium perception
- Conversion friction at payment moments

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Strong trust signals in UX/content (licensing info, security badges)
- Emphasize brand personality in marketing
- Accept lower conversion rate for higher visibility
- Target youth-oriented channels (social, sports partnerships)

**Confidence Level: MODERATE-HIGH**
Logo 1's memorability dominance makes it viable IF:
- 40+ demographic is not primary target
- Trust can be established through means beyond logo
- Acquisition volume justifies conversion trade-off

**Risk:** May win awareness but struggle with conversion

---

### If Category Fit is Paramount: Logo 4 (Modernized)

**Choose Modernized Logo 4 when:**
- Immediate category recognition essential
- Targeting experienced gamblers
- Mass-market positioning desired
- Familiar gaming aesthetic preferred
- Category-first brand strategy
- IF modernization successfully updates execution

**Current Logo 4 Performance:**
- iGaming Fit: 4.1/5 (HIGHEST)
- Trust: 3.4/5 (acceptable)
- Mass-Market: 100% (universal)

**Fatal Flaw: Dated Execution**
- Modernity: 3.1/5 (shadow effect criticized)
- "2010-2015 era" aesthetic
- High brand equity risk (ages poorly)

**Modernization Hypothesis:**
- Remove dated shadow effect
- Preserve bold uppercase and visual weight
- Maintain 4.1/5 category fit
- Improve 3.1/5 modernity score
- Create "best of both worlds" solution

**Modernized Logo 4 Potential:**
- Category fit (4.1/5) + Modern execution (estimated 4.0+/5)
- Could combine Logo 4's recognition + Logo 2's modernity
- Lower risk than bold Logo 1, more distinctive than subtle Logo 2

**Confidence Level: MODERATE**
Requires testing to validate modernization preserves category fit

**Recommendation:**
- Create modernized version
- Test in Phase 2 alongside Logos 1 and 2
- Choose based on comparative performance

**Risk:** If modernization fails, lose category fit advantage

## Final Recommendations Summary

### Primary Recommendation: Execute Phase 2

**Rationale:**
The strategic tension between Logo 2 (trust) and Logo 1 (memorability) requires competitive context data to resolve confidently.

**What Phase 2 Will Reveal:**
1. Which logo wins when forced to choose (preference ranking)
2. Whether trust or memorability drives final decisions
3. How age demographics split in head-to-head comparison
4. Context-specific performance (app store vs. payment page)
5. Whether Modernized Logo 4 can compete with top performers

**Confidence:** This is the RIGHT next step

---

### Secondary Recommendation: If Choosing Now (Without Phase 2)

**Strategic Choice: Logo 2**

**Rationale:**
- Highest trust (4.1/5) critical for gambling conversion
- Dominant with 40+ demographic (80% approval, highest LTV segment)
- Cross-generational appeal (works for all ages)
- Premium quality perception (34% premium votes)
- Versatile across products (casino, sports, data, games)
- Lowest risk option (broadly acceptable)

**Trade-Off Acceptance:**
- Lower distinctiveness (44% vs. 58% memorable)
- Generic category signaling (3.7/5 vs. 4.1/5 category fit)
- May struggle in discovery contexts

**Mitigation:**
- Strong app store creative compensates
- Marketing emphasizes "YES GAMES" category clarity
- Focus acquisition on conversion channels, not just awareness
- Trust advantage drives retention and LTV

**Confidence Level: HIGH**

**When to Choose Logo 2 Now:**
- 40+ demographic is strategic priority
- Trust and retention valued over acquisition speed
- Premium or sophisticated positioning desired
- Risk minimization important

---

### Tertiary Recommendation: Consider Logo 1 IF...

**Choose Logo 1 if:**
- Primary target is under-30 demographic
- Sports betting is core focus (speed, energy critical)
- Brand awareness/recognition prioritized over conversion efficiency
- Competitive market requires standout visibility
- Accept lower 40+ demographic performance

**Confidence Level: MODERATE**

**Risk Acceptance Required:**
- Lower trust (3.0/5) impacts conversion
- 40+ demographic dissatisfaction (highest LTV segment)
- Zero premium perception
- Trust signals must come from UX/content, not logo

---

### Elimination Confirmations

**Do NOT Proceed With:**

**Logo 3 (Script):**
- 74% budget perception
- 2.2/5 trust (unacceptable)
- 2.1/5 category fit (inappropriate tone)
- Only 6% memorable

**Logo 6 (Rounded Script):**
- 100% budget perception (unanimous)
- 1.8/5 trust (worst score)
- 1.5/5 category fit (worst score)
- Universal category mismatch

**Logo 7 (Abstract Monogram):**
- 84% confusion (mixed/unclear perception)
- 2.0/5 trust (cognitive friction)
- 1.7/5 category fit (wrong context for abstraction)
- Memorable for negative reasons

**Confidence in Eliminations: VERY HIGH**

These three logos show no viable path forward. Resources should focus on top performers (1, 2, 4, 5).
