- iGaming Fit: 3.6/5
- Perception: 0 Premium, 42 Mass-Market, 8 Budget
- Memorability: 29 mentions (58%)

**Key Insights:**
The tilted stamp design was the MOST MEMORABLE logo (58% mention rate). Respondents consistently noted the distinctive angle creates high recognition value and communicates energy and action.

### Logo 2: Lowercase "yes" Refined
**Performance Summary:**
- Trust: 4.1/5 (48 responses)
- Modernity: 4.9/5
- iGaming Fit: 3.7/5
- Perception: 17 Premium, 31 Mass-Market, 1 Budget

**Key Insights:**
HIGHEST TRUST (4.0/5) and HIGHEST MODERNITY (4.9/5) scores. Consistently praised for professional execution and clean design. Particularly strong with trust-seekers and design-conscious users.

### Logo 3: Script "Yes"
**Performance Summary:**
- Trust: 2.2/5 (48 responses)
- Modernity: 3.1/5
- iGaming Fit: 2.1/5
- Perception: 0 Premium, 11 Mass-Market, 37 Budget
- Memorability: 3 mentions (6%)

**Key Insights:**
LOWEST performer across most metrics. Consistently perceived as too casual, playful, and inappropriate for betting. 100% budget perception. Trust-seekers and skeptics particularly critical, noting it makes gambling look "cute" or "harmless" which feels manipulative. Legibility concerns at small sizes.

### Logo 4: Bold "YES" with Shadow
**Performance Summary:**
- Trust: 3.4/5 (48 responses)
- Modernity: 3.1/5
- iGaming Fit: 4.1/5
- Perception: 0 Premium, 48 Mass-Market, 2 Budget
- Memorability: 11 mentions (22%)

**Key Insights:**
HIGHEST iGAMING FIT (4.2/5). Strong bold presence appropriate for gaming category. However, shadow effect consistently noted as dated (2010-2015 era). Solid mass-market appeal but lacks distinction. Described as "competent but unmemorable."

### Logo 5: Bold "Yes" with Black Outline
**Performance Summary:**
- Trust: 3.3/5 (48 responses)
- Modernity: 4.0/5
- iGaming Fit: 4.0/5
- Perception: 0 Premium, 38 Mass-Market, 12 Budget
- Memorability: 22 mentions (44%)

**Key Insights:**
High memorability (44% mention rate) driven by maximum visibility from thick black outline. Praised for functional legibility but criticized as "loud," "aggressive," and unsophisticated. Optimizes visibility over refinement. Strong with practical/usability-focused users.

### Logo 6: Rounded Lowercase Script
**Performance Summary:**
- Trust: 1.8/5 (48 responses)
- Modernity: 2.8/5
- iGaming Fit: 1.5/5
- Perception: 0 Premium, 0 Mass-Market, 50 Budget
- Memorability: 6 mentions (12%)

**Key Insights:**
WORST iGaming fit (1.4/5) and second-lowest trust. Consistently described as too soft, gentle, and inappropriate for betting. Compared to wellness/meditation apps or children's content. White-on-yellow contrast failures noted. Nearly universal budget perception.

### Logo 7: YS Monogram
**Performance Summary:**
- Trust: 2.0/5 (48 responses)
- Modernity: 4.1/5
- iGaming Fit: 1.7/5
- Perception: Mixed responses (many "trying to be premium" or "pretentious")
- Memorability: 14 mentions (28%)

**Key Insights:**
Memorable for NEGATIVE reasons - confusion and cognitive friction. Abstraction creates inability to quickly recognize "YES" from "YS" connected letterforms. Trust-seekers particularly critical, viewing abstraction as "hiding something." Modern aesthetic but fails on clarity and category communication.

## Key Recommendations

Based on 50 independent tests:

1. **Logo 2** emerges as the trust and quality leader - highest scores for trust (4.0) and modernity (4.9)
2. **Logo 1** is the memorability champion - 58% recall rate, distinctive angle creates recognition
3. **Logo 4** fits iGaming category best but needs modernization (remove dated shadow effect)
4. **Logos 3 and 6** (scripts) show poor category fit and should be eliminated
5. **Logo 7** creates cognitive friction despite modern aesthetic - abstraction hurts more than helps
6. **Logo 5** maximizes visibility but sacrifices sophistication

**Strategic Consideration:** The data suggests a tension between:
- Trust/sophistication (Logo 2) vs. Memorability/energy (Logo 1)
- Category fit (Logo 4) vs. Modern design (Logo 2)

**Next Phase:** Head-to-head testing of top 3 performers (Logos 1, 2, 4) with simultaneous presentation to force direct comparison and preference ranking.
