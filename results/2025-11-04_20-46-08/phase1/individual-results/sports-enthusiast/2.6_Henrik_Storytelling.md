# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Nostalgic
A2. **What kind of company:** Reminds me of those retro game shops I used to visit with my dad
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It's friendly, like the old betting shops where everyone knew each other. But maybe a bit too casual for today's standards.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - It has that throwback feel, like the script on vintage football programmes my grandfather collected
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, in an honest way

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - There's something about it that takes me back to when betting was simpler. My father used to fill out football pools with a pen just like this script style.
C2. **Target audience:** People like me who remember when things weren't so corporate and polished. Traditional fans.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The script reminds me of the handwritten betting slips my dad used to keep in his desk drawer - he'd save the winning ones as memories. That personal, human touch feels authentic. But I'm not sure younger fans would get that same feeling. It might just look unpolished to them. The playful style works for the casual side of betting, but when I'm putting real money on OB's next match, I want something that feels a bit more substantial. It's like the difference between a friendly kickabout and an actual Superliga match.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Welcoming
A2. **What kind of company:** Community app, maybe something for local sports clubs
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too soft for betting. It's like showing up to a match in sandals instead of proper boots.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The roundness is current but something feels off
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This doesn't capture the tradition and weight of sports betting. When my father took me to my first match and explained how betting worked, there was a sense of gravity to it - this is too bubbly.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe for casual mobile gamers who don't take it seriously? Not for someone with decades of football in their blood.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I appreciate that it's trying to be friendly and approachable - reminds me of how welcoming the atmosphere was at our local club when I was growing up. Everyone was friendly, but they also respected the game. This logo is all friendliness without the respect. Back in the day, even the casual betting had a sense of tradition behind it. This feels like it forgot where it came from. The rounded letters might work for some trendy new app, but for sports betting? We need something with more backbone. It's missing the heritage.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Sports brand or action-focused entertainment
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The angle gives it energy but also makes it feel less grounded. Like a player who's all pace but no positioning.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The stamp style reminds me of match-day tickets, but updated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with personality

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - There's something about the tilted frame that captures that moment when a goal is scored and everyone jumps up at an angle, celebrations going wild. It has that match-day energy.
C2. **Target audience:** Fans who live for those explosive moments. The ones who've been following their team through thick and thin.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The stamp aesthetic takes me back to collecting match tickets and programmes - I've got boxes of them from decades of following OB. There's a story in every stub. This logo has that same collectible quality, like it's saying "this moment matters." The angle is interesting too - it reminds me of how nothing ever goes perfectly straight in football. The ball takes unexpected bounces, players make diagonal runs, the game flows at angles. That's part of what makes it beautiful. But I wonder if the tilt might get old over time. Match-day programmes from the 60s and 70s that my dad saved? They're classic because they're timeless and straight. This might date itself. Still, it has character and tells a story visually, which I respect.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Powerful
A2. **What kind of company:** Sports betting or gaming platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The boldness reminds me of those confident calls from veteran commentators who've seen it all
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow effect feels like early 2010s design, when everything got that treatment
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - When Denmark beat France at Euro 92 - that was a moment that felt this bold. The shadow gives it that sense of a historic moment casting a long memory.
C2. **Target audience:** Traditional sports fans who want their betting platform to feel as substantial as the game itself.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The shadow effect reminds me of how the floodlights at our stadium cast long shadows across the pitch during evening matches. There's drama in shadows. My grandfather used to say every game has two stories - what you see in the light and what lingers in the shadow. This logo captures both. The bold text is like a decisive header into the back of the net - no hesitation, just confidence. But I have to say, the shadow technique feels a bit like a trend that had its moment. I'm reminded of those redesigned team badges from 10 years ago that all tried to look "modern" with effects like this, and now they're updating them again. Will this still feel right in another decade? When I look at classic logos from legendary clubs, they endure because they're cleaner. This has impact now, but I'm not sure about its legacy.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Abstract
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything - finance, fashion, who knows?
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - It's too cryptic. Reminds me of those rebrands that strip away all the history and heritage for "simplicity."
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The monogram approach is contemporary
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying for premium but feels disconnected

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This doesn't tell me anything about sports, betting, or entertainment. It's like when clubs redesign their badges and remove all the meaningful symbols - you're left with something that could be anything.
C2. **Target audience:** People who care more about looking sophisticated than actual substance? Not for traditional fans.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** There's a story I think about sometimes - when Juventus changed their badge to just "J" in a black and white design, a lot of longtime fans felt disconnected from it. It was modern and clean, but it lost the soul. This monogram gives me the same feeling. The connected "YS" letterforms are clever from a design perspective, but there's no narrative there. No connection to the heritage of betting, sports, or gaming. When I teach history, I always tell my students that symbols matter because they carry meaning forward through time. What meaning does this carry? I can't read a story in it. For someone like me, who's been following football and betting since my father first explained odds to me at age ten, I need something that acknowledges that tradition. This feels like it was designed in a vacuum by someone who never sat in the stands on a rainy Tuesday night. It's technically modern, but soulless.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Contemporary
A2. **What kind of company:** Modern entertainment platform, possibly streaming or lifestyle
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The refinement suggests professionalism, like a well-organized club with good management
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very current, like how clubs are modernizing their training facilities
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with quality standards

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It works, but there's a story missing. It's functional without the folklore.
C2. **Target audience:** Younger generation who didn't grow up with the same traditions. They want clean and efficient.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This makes me think about the evolution of football itself. When I watch old footage from the 80s and compare it to today's game, everything is faster, cleaner, more professional. This logo represents that modern approach - refined, minimalist, efficient. My students would probably connect with this more than I do. They like things streamlined and modern. But here's what I wonder - in 30 years, will someone look back at this logo with the same nostalgia I have for the old designs? Or will it just blend into the background of hundreds of other minimalist logos from this era? The lowercase approach is interesting - it's less aggressive, more conversational. Like you're saying "yes" to a friend rather than shouting "YES!" at a match. For betting, which is becoming more mainstream and social, maybe that's the right tone. But I miss the character. It's like new stadiums versus old ones - the new ones are better in every practical way, but the old ones had stories in every corner.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Emphatic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or entertainment app
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The bold outline is like a player who's very vocal - confident but maybe trying a bit too hard
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Bold and current, like modern sports branding
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The bold approach works for the energy of sports betting. When your team scores in the last minute, you want to scream YES just like this.
C2. **Target audience:** Passionate fans who bet with emotion as much as logic. The ones who celebrate wildly and suffer deeply.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick black outline reminds me of the old team pennants that used to hang in pubs - bold text with strong borders, designed to be seen from across a crowded room. There's a directness to this that I appreciate. It doesn't hide what it is. When I was younger, my father took me to watch OB play, and in the pub before the match, all the betting talk was direct and honest - "I'm putting money on a 2-1 win." No pretense. This logo has that same energy. But there's a fine line between confident and loud. The outline is almost like someone underlining something twice - we get it, it's important. The message would come through even without the heavy border. It's a bit like a striker who celebrates too dramatically - yes, you scored, but settle down. Still, I'd rather have this boldness than something timid. In both football and betting, you need to commit fully. This logo commits. Whether that ages well is another question, but in the moment, it has passion.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted stamp frame tells a story immediately. It reminds me of collecting match tickets through the years - each one at a different angle in my memory box, each one marking a moment. That tilt makes it memorable because it breaks the pattern.

**Logo 4** - The shadow effect stuck with me because it reminded me of evening matches under the floodlights. My father used to say the best games were played when the shadows were long. There's something about how this creates depth that connects to those memories.

**Logo 7** - I remember this one because I spent time trying to figure it out, like working through a historical puzzle in class. The monogram is clever but confusing. That mental effort makes it memorable, even though I'm not sure it's the right kind of memorable for a betting platform.

The others blend together a bit more - they're variations on the bold text theme without the distinctive elements that trigger a specific memory or story. When I think back on logos that endure - like classic football badges - they have elements that tell a story. That's what makes them last.
