# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Sophisticated
A2. **What kind of company:** Modern tech platform, possibly entertainment or streaming
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The refined aesthetic suggests attention to detail, which translates to trust. When I see clean typography like this, it signals that the development team probably cares about the overall product quality, not just the backend.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - This is contemporary design language. The lowercase approach, minimal style, and gradient treatments are all current trends in app design.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with premium aspirations

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - It works well because it doesn't lean into gambling cliches. The way I see it, if you're building a modern betting platform, you want to distance yourself from the traditional image of gambling and move toward something that feels more like tech entertainment. This accomplishes that.
C2. **Target audience:** Younger millennials and Gen Z who are comfortable with technology. People who care about aesthetics and want their apps to feel premium without being pretentious.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The typography is well-executed - clean sans-serif with good letterform proportions. The gradients provide visual interest without overwhelming the text. What I appreciate is the restraint; they didn't try to add too many effects or embellishments. From a technical perspective, this would render well at various sizes, which is important for responsive design across devices. However, I do wonder about contrast ratios on some of the darker gradient backgrounds - when you're analyzing odds during a match and need to quickly identify the app, you want maximum legibility. The white text on the darker purple/blue gradients might fall below WCAG AA standards. That said, if you analyze the overall package, this is probably the most professionally designed option I've seen so far.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Approachable
A2. **What kind of company:** Lifestyle app, wellness, or casual social platform
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The problem with the rounded script is that it feels insubstantial. When I'm placing bets with real money, I need to feel like the platform is robust and secure. This looks friendly but not secure.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Rounded scripts have been trending, but this execution feels generic rather than distinctive
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget to mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Here's why this doesn't work for betting: the visual language is completely wrong for the use case. Sports betting requires speed, confidence, and reliability. The rounded, flowing letterforms communicate softness and casualness. When you're trying to get a bet in before kickoff, you don't want to tap an icon that looks like it's for a meditation app.
C2. **Target audience:** This might appeal to very casual users who are intimidated by traditional gambling interfaces, but I don't think that's a large enough market segment to build around. Most sports bettors want something that feels powerful and capable.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Let me walk through the issues systematically. First, legibility: script fonts have inherent readability problems at small sizes because the stroke widths vary and letters connect. At app icon size (60x60px or smaller), this will lose definition. Second, the contrast issues are significant - particularly the white text on yellow background, which has a contrast ratio that likely fails accessibility guidelines. Third, the personality mismatch: if you analyze successful betting apps, they almost universally use bold, confident typography because that's what communicates reliability and speed. The rounded script communicates the opposite. From a design perspective, I understand they might be trying to differentiate from competitors, but this overcorrects and ends up feeling out of category.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Powerful
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or sports betting platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The bold typography and strong contrast suggest confidence and reliability. The shadow effect adds dimension, which subconsciously signals depth and substance.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The drop shadow technique feels slightly dated. It was heavily used in the 2010s and has since fallen out of favor in minimalist design trends. That said, it's not egregiously outdated.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - This fits the category extremely well. The boldness communicates the energy and immediacy of live betting. When you're watching a match and need to place a quick bet, you want an interface that feels responsive and powerful. This delivers that.
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream sports bettors, probably skewing male, ages 25-45. People who want straightforward, no-nonsense functionality and don't care about trendy design aesthetics.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a functional standpoint, this works very well. The heavy weight ensures excellent readability at any size. The high contrast between the white text and colored backgrounds means it will be visible in various lighting conditions - important when you're checking odds on your phone at a stadium or sports bar. The shadow adds depth and helps the text pop off the background. Now, the reason I marked it down slightly on the "modern" scale is because design trends have moved toward flatter, more minimal treatments. The shadow feels like visual ornamentation rather than functional necessity. That said, if you analyze this from a purely pragmatic betting-app perspective rather than a design-trends perspective, it accomplishes its goals. It's bold, clear, and instantly communicates its category. The gradient backgrounds add visual variety for different app states or categories, which is smart from a UX architecture standpoint.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Abstract
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything - finance, consulting, fashion. The ambiguity is the problem.
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The abstraction creates uncertainty, and uncertainty is the enemy of trust. When I can't immediately understand what I'm looking at, I question whether the company has clearly thought through its brand identity.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monogram logos are a modern trend, especially in the tech and startup space
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Attempting premium positioning

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This is completely wrong for the category. Let me explain why: betting apps need immediate recognition and clear communication because users access them in high-pressure, time-sensitive situations. During a live match, I need to open my betting app quickly - I'm scanning my home screen for that specific icon. The "YS" monogram doesn't read as "YES" at first glance, which creates cognitive friction. That fraction of a second delay matters when odds are changing in real-time.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe users who prioritize exclusivity and sophistication over clarity? But I don't think that's the core betting market.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The way I see it, there's a fundamental misunderstanding here about what a betting app logo needs to do. The connected letterforms are interesting from a pure design perspective - they show some creative thought about how to merge Y and S into a cohesive mark. But interesting doesn't mean effective. If you analyze this from a user experience perspective, which is how I naturally think about these things, it fails on several levels. First, the recognition test: if I showed this to ten people who hadn't heard of YES Games, how many would correctly identify it as "YES"? Probably very few. Second, the scalability test: at app icon size, those thin connecting lines might not render cleanly, especially on older devices or lower-resolution screens. Third, the category fit test: does this look like a betting app? No. It could be anything. In software development, we talk about the principle of least surprise - your interface should behave in expected ways. This logo violates that principle by being unexpectedly abstract when the category demands clarity.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Impactful
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or entertainment platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The bold outline creates strong definition and presence, which translates to perceived reliability
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The thick outline trend is relatively current, popular in app icon design
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - This works excellently for the category because it maximizes visibility and impact, which are key for betting apps
C2. **Target audience:** Sports bettors who want clear, immediate recognition. People who value functionality over subtlety.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Let me analyze this systematically. The thick black outline serves multiple functions: it creates maximum contrast against any background (important for visibility in different contexts), it ensures the text reads clearly at small sizes, and it gives the logo a distinctive, memorable silhouette. From a technical perspective, this is smart design for mobile applications. The contrast ratio is excellent across all gradient variations, which means it passes accessibility standards. The bold treatment communicates energy and confidence without relying on effects like shadows or gradients in the typography itself. Now, the potential criticism is that the heavy outline might feel aggressive or crude compared to more refined options. But if you think about the use case - quickly identifying your betting app while watching a match, often in suboptimal lighting conditions - this aggressive clarity is actually a feature, not a bug. The "Yes" capitalization is interesting; it's less shouty than "YES" but more substantial than "yes." That's a good middle ground. The gradient backgrounds provide variety while the consistent black outline maintains brand recognition across variations. From a betting app perspective, analyzing this against requirements like speed of recognition, clarity in various contexts, and appropriate category communication, this is one of the strongest options.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Casual
A2. **What kind of company:** Lifestyle brand or social platform
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The script feels too informal for a platform where I'm managing money and placing bets
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts trend in and out, this feels a bit past its peak
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - The issue here is tonal mismatch. Sports betting is fundamentally about competition, analysis, and decisive action. This script logo feels hesitant and decorative rather than confident and functional.
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users who might play occasionally but aren't serious bettors. Maybe younger users who are intimidated by traditional gambling interfaces.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a technical and strategic perspective, there are several problems with this approach. First, the readability issue: script typography has inherently poor legibility at small sizes because of the connecting strokes and varying line weights. When you scale this down to a 60x60 pixel app icon, those flowing connections will blur together. Second, the personality problem: the script conveys friendliness and approachability, which might seem like positive qualities, but for sports betting they actually work against you. I need my betting app to feel powerful, reliable, and fast - not friendly and casual. Third, the contrast issues: the script places a lot of curved surface area against the background, which means some portions of the letters have less contrast than you'd get with clean, straight-edged typography. When you analyze successful sports betting apps, they almost universally use bold, clear typography that communicates speed and confidence. This script approach feels like it's trying to soften gambling, but serious bettors don't want it softened - they want it efficient and powerful. The colorful backgrounds are fine, but they can't compensate for typography that's fundamentally misaligned with user needs and category expectations.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment, gaming, or event platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The tilt adds energy but the solid frame provides structure, creating a balance between excitement and reliability
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The stamp/sticker aesthetic is currently trendy in app design
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - The tilted angle perfectly captures the energy and excitement of live sports betting. It suggests movement and action, which aligns with the dynamic nature of in-play betting.
C2. **Target audience:** Sports bettors who want excitement and energy from their platform. Probably younger demographic, 20s and 30s.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Let me break down why this design is effective for betting. The tilt is psychologically interesting - it breaks the grid and suggests action and excitement, which is exactly what you feel when you're betting on a live match. The rectangular frame provides structure and containment, which creates a sense of reliability within the excitement. From a recognition standpoint, the angled silhouette is highly distinctive. When I'm scrolling through my home screen looking for my betting app, that tilted rectangle will catch my eye immediately because it breaks the pattern of square icons. That's good UX design - using disruption strategically for recognition. The bold "YES" text is clear and confident. The gradient backgrounds add visual variety while maintaining the consistent tilted frame for brand recognition. Now, here's a potential issue from a technical perspective: the angled orientation creates an irregular footprint that doesn't tile naturally with other app icons. Most mobile OS interfaces are designed around a grid system, and this deliberately breaks that grid. In isolation, it looks dynamic and energetic. But when placed among other apps, it might create visual tension. That said, if you analyze this from a betting-specific perspective rather than a general design perspective, that disruption is actually valuable because it ensures the app stands out. When odds are changing during a match and I need to access the app quickly, that distinctive tilted profile helps me find it faster. The boldness and clarity ensure readability. Overall, if you think about the specific requirements of sports betting - speed, energy, recognition, and reliability - this design addresses those requirements effectively.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted rectangular frame is the most distinctive element I've seen. It breaks the expected pattern, which makes it memorable. From a psychological perspective, things that violate our expectations tend to stick in memory better than things that conform. The angle creates a unique silhouette that would be easy to recall later.

**Logo 5** - The thick black outline creates a strong, clear impression. It's the highest contrast option, which means it makes a bold visual statement. I remember thinking about how well this would work at small sizes, and that practical consideration helps it stick in memory.

**Logo 2** - I remember this one because it felt like the most sophisticated and carefully designed option. The refinement of the typography stood out, and I spent time analyzing the contrast ratios and considering how it would perform across different use cases.

The reason these three stand out while the others blur together is that each has a distinctive element: Logo 1 has the angle, Logo 5 has the heavy outline, and Logo 2 has the refined aesthetic. The other logos (3, 4, 6, 7) either lack distinctive features or have features that work against them. Logo 7 is memorable for the wrong reason - it confused me. Logos 3 and 6 both use script, which makes them feel similar and causes them to merge in memory. Logo 4 is bold but doesn't have a unique enough characteristic to differentiate it from Logo 5. When you're analyzing recall, distinctiveness is key, and these three logos achieve distinctiveness through different means.
