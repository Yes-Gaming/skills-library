# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Manipulative
A2. **What kind of company:** Trying to look friendly to hide predatory practices
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - The overly casual script feels like it's trying to make gambling seem harmless and fun, which is exactly the tactic problematic operators use to downplay the risks
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts come and go
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, trying to appeal to vulnerable users

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - I'm skeptical of this because it seems designed to make betting feel casual and consequence-free, which is irresponsible
C2. **Target audience:** Younger, inexperienced users who might not understand the risks of gambling

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Look, I cover the gambling industry, and I've seen how operators use design psychology to manipulate users. This script approach feels like it's trying to soften gambling, make it seem fun and harmless. But gambling isn't harmless - it's a serious activity involving real money. The playful script is a red flag to me because it suggests the operator isn't taking responsible gambling seriously. The mix of cursive text with bright, colorful backgrounds looks like a kids' app, which is concerning. Most betting apps try to look serious because they know they're in a regulated, sensitive industry. This looks like it's trying to bypass those concerns by seeming innocent and fun.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Aggressive
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile gaming or betting platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The heavy-handed approach makes me wonder if they're compensating for something. Why do you need such a thick outline unless you're trying too hard?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Current trend in app design
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - It fits the category, but the aggressive styling concerns me slightly
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream bettors who want something bold and clear

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick black outline is effective for visibility, I'll give it that. You can't miss this on a screen. But I'm skeptical of design choices that feel like they're shouting. Most betting sites are predatory or at least ethically questionable, and the ones that shout the loudest often have the most to hide. That said, this isn't as concerning as some other options - at least it's straightforward and doesn't try to manipulate through false friendliness. The bold approach could be seen as honest about what it is. But the heavy outline still feels like it's trying to dominate your attention, which makes me question what else about the app might be attention-grabbing or pushy.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gimmicky
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment platform trying too hard to be different
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The tilt feels like a design trick to stand out rather than a genuine brand expression. I'm skeptical of companies that rely on visual gimmicks.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Trendy sticker aesthetic
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It works for gaming but the tilt feels like a cheap trick for attention
C2. **Target audience:** Younger users who respond to trendy visual styles

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I've written articles about how betting companies use design psychology to attract and retain users, often in manipulative ways. The tilted angle here is clearly meant to grab attention and suggest energy, but it feels calculated rather than authentic. Why tilt it? To be different? To stand out on an app store shelf? Those motivations aren't about serving users - they're about market competition. Most betting apps use these kinds of visual hooks to mask the fact that the house always wins. The gradient backgrounds are generic, suggesting they haven't put real thought into brand identity beyond "let's tilt it to look edgy." I'm skeptical because I know the industry well - when operators focus on flashy design instead of transparent terms and responsible gambling features, that's a red flag.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Pretentious
A2. **What kind of company:** Trying to seem sophisticated and exclusive
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The abstraction feels like it's hiding something. Why not just say what you are?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monograms are trendy
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Pretending to be premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This doesn't communicate betting at all, which makes me suspicious about what they're actually offering
C2. **Target audience:** People who value exclusivity over transparency, which is concerning

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I'm immediately skeptical of any gambling brand that hides behind abstraction. The monogram approach feels like it's trying to obscure what this company actually does. In my experience covering the industry, the operators who use vague, sophisticated branding are often the ones with questionable practices. They want to distance themselves from the reality of gambling by seeming exclusive and refined. But gambling is gambling - trying to dress it up with abstract monograms doesn't change that. The connected letterforms don't clearly spell "YES," which creates unnecessary confusion. If you can't be straightforward about your logo, what else aren't you being straightforward about? Hidden terms? RTP rates? Withdrawal processes? The abstraction breeds suspicion.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dated
A2. **What kind of company:** Gambling platform using old design tricks
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The shadow effect feels like a dated attempt to create impact. Makes me wonder if their platform is equally dated.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - The drop shadow is a 2010s technique that feels outdated now
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - It fits betting, but the dated styling makes me question the company's attention to current standards
C2. **Target audience:** Older bettors who might not notice dated design

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The bold text is clear and the shadow adds contrast, but I'm skeptical of companies that use dated design techniques because it suggests they're not keeping up with industry standards. In gambling, you want operators who stay current with regulation, security, and technology. If they're using design trends from 2012, what else about their operation is outdated? Their security protocols? Their responsible gambling tools? The shadow effect feels like trying to create impact through visual tricks rather than genuine brand value. Most betting sites are predatory or have hidden terms, and the ones using flashy effects often do so to distract from their actual offering. That said, this is less concerning than the overtly manipulative friendly scripts or pretentious monograms. At least it's direct about being a bold, straightforward gambling platform.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Deceptive
A2. **What kind of company:** Gambling operator trying to look harmless
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - This is exactly the kind of soft, friendly branding that problematic operators use to make gambling seem safe and fun when it's actually risky
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Generic rounded script
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, targeting vulnerable users

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This is wrong for betting in a way that concerns me. Gambling should look serious because it IS serious.
C2. **Target audience:** People who might underestimate gambling risks, which is ethically problematic

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I'm very skeptical of this approach because I've seen how the gambling industry uses "soft" branding to normalize betting and make it seem harmless. The rounded, friendly script is clearly designed to lower psychological barriers to gambling. It makes betting look cute and approachable when it should look serious and regulated. This is a red flag for me. Having covered gambling industry tactics, I know that operators often use friendly branding to appeal to younger or more vulnerable users who might not fully understand the risks. The white text on yellow background has terrible contrast, which suggests they care more about looking friendly than about basic usability or accessibility. Most betting sites have questionable ethics, and the ones that use this kind of manipulative "friendly" branding are often the worst offenders. At least aggressive bold logos are honest about what they are - this tries to hide reality behind a smile.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Tech-bro
A2. **What kind of company:** Tech startup trying to disrupt gambling (which usually means finding new ways to extract money)
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The sleek design feels like tech companies who claim to be "different" but usually just have better marketing
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very current design trends
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with premium aspirations

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It works aesthetically but I'm skeptical of gambling platforms that try to look like cool tech startups
C2. **Target audience:** Younger users who might be attracted to the tech aesthetic without questioning the business model

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Look, the design is well-executed - clean typography, modern gradients, minimal aesthetic. I can appreciate good design. But I'm skeptical of betting platforms that dress themselves up like tech companies. The refined, lowercase, sleek approach is straight out of the startup playbook: look innovative and friendly to distract from the fact that you're still a gambling operator where the house has the edge. Having covered the industry, I've seen this pattern before - new betting platforms use sophisticated design to attract younger users who associate this aesthetic with trustworthy tech brands like Spotify or Airbnb. But gambling isn't Spotify. The slick branding can mask predatory practices. The lowercase "yes" feels like it's trying to whisper affirmation rather than honestly state what it is. That said, if I had to choose from these options, at least this one isn't aggressively manipulative like the script options or pretentiously abstract like the monogram. It's straightforward enough, even if I'm skeptical of the tech-startup cosplay.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 3** - I remember this one because the playful script immediately triggered my skepticism about manipulative design practices in gambling. When something concerns me professionally, it sticks.

**Logo 6** - Similar reason - the overly friendly rounded script felt deceptive and concerning. These "soft" gambling brands are often the ones with the most problematic practices.

**Logo 7** - The pretentious monogram stood out because of how it tries to hide what the company actually does. The abstraction bred suspicion.

I remember these three because they raised red flags. The others blur together more as variations of "standard bold betting logos" - they're less memorable because they don't trigger the same critical analysis. When you cover the gambling industry professionally, you develop a sensitivity to design tactics that try to manipulate or obscure, and those are what stick in memory.
