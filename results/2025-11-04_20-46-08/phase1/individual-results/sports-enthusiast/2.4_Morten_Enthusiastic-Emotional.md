The contrast is amazing - I can see this being super easy to spot on my phone when I'm watching a match. The "Yes" with capital Y is perfect - it's assertive without being too shouty.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is well-designed and looks sophisticated, but I don't feel the ENERGY! When I'm betting on a match, I want to feel excited and pumped up! This is too calm and understated. The lowercase is refined but it doesn't capture the emotion of sports. It's like watching a match on mute - technically fine but missing the atmosphere! The gradients are nice, but the overall vibe is too chill for the adrenaline of live betting. Still looks good though!

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confused
A2. **What kind of company:** No idea - could be anything
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Can't tell what it is, which makes me uncertain
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Modern style
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying to be premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Doesn't feel like sports or betting at all!
C2. **Target audience:** I don't know who this is for

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I don't get it! When I'm watching a match and need to place a bet quickly, I need to recognize my app INSTANTLY! This abstract monogram doesn't read as "YES" - it's too complicated! Where's the energy? Where's the excitement? Sports betting is about passion and emotion, and this is just... lines? It's too intellectual and abstract when what I need is something that matches the raw emotion of a match! Not feeling it at all!

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Soft
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app or something casual
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too light and playful for betting with real money
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Feels a bit dated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Wrong vibe for sports betting!
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe very casual players?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This doesn't match the intensity of sports AT ALL! When I'm coaching, I pump up my players with energy and passion - this script is too gentle and delicate! Sports betting needs to feel POWERFUL and EXCITING, not soft and playful! The cursive style reminds me of greeting cards, not the rush of a last-minute goal! The colorful backgrounds try to add energy but the script typography kills it. This would be fine for a yoga app but not for the THRILL of live betting!

---

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gentle
A2. **What kind of company:** Kids' app or wellness platform
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Way too soft for betting
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Generic
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Completely wrong for betting!
C2. **Target audience:** Not sports fans!

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** No no no! This is all wrong! Sports betting is about INTENSITY, EXCITEMENT, and ENERGY! This rounded, soft script is the complete opposite! It's like trying to watch a championship match with the volume turned down! Where's the passion? Where's the fire? When my bet comes through during a match, I want to feel like a champion - this logo makes me feel like I'm being patted on the head! The friendly style totally misses what makes sports betting thrilling! Hard pass!

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - ABSOLUTELY! The tilted stamp is SO distinctive and energetic! It captured the feeling of excitement perfectly! That angle is burned into my memory!

**Logo 5** - YES! The thick black outline is so BOLD and powerful! It made a strong impression - that's what I want from a betting app!

**Logo 4** - The all-caps YES with shadow felt strong and exciting! It stood out because it matched the energy of sports!

The soft scripts (3 and 6) are forgettable because they don't have the EMOTION! Logo 7 confused me so it's memorable for the wrong reason. Logo 2 was nice but too calm to really stick. The ones with ENERGY and POWER are what I remember - that's what sports betting is all about!
