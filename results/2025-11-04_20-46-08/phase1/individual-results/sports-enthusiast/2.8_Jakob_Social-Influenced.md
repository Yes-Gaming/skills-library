# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Impactful
A2. **What kind of company:** Sports betting or gaming platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - My betting group would see this as legit and professional
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Everyone I know uses apps with similar bold styles, though some think shadows are getting old
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, which is what most people use

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - This is exactly what my friends and I expect from a betting app. Bold, clear, energetic.
C2. **Target audience:** Our betting group - guys in their late 20s to mid-30s who bet regularly during matches

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** My friends would approve of this one. It has that confident, strong look that makes you feel good about using it. When we're sharing our bet slips in the group chat, the logo shows up in the screenshot, and this would look solid. It's not trying to be fancy or overthink things - just direct and powerful. The shadow effect gives it some depth, which people in my circle appreciate. We've talked about app design before, and most of us agree that too minimal looks cheap while too complex looks cluttered. This hits a middle ground. That said, a couple of my friends who work in design have mentioned that the shadow trend is fading. They say it's very 2012-2015 style. So while it works now and would definitely be accepted in our social circle, I wonder if in a year or two we'd all be talking about how dated it looks. Social consensus matters when you're recommending apps to friends.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Action sports or entertainment brand
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It's different, which some people in my group would love and others would question
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The angle and stamp style feel current, like what younger brands are doing
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with personality

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The energy matches how we feel during live betting. When your team scores, you want to jump and shout at angles like this.
C2. **Target audience:** People in my social circle who like brands with personality. We share stuff that stands out.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This would definitely spark conversation in our betting group chat. It's different enough that people would comment on it, which could be good or bad. Some of my friends really appreciate when brands take risks and do something distinctive - they'd probably think this is cool and fresh. Others prefer things more traditional and proven. I showed a similar tilted design to my group once (a different app), and reactions were mixed. The stamp style is interesting because it feels collectible, like limited edition stuff. My generation likes that aesthetic - we grew up with stickers and stamps being cool. From a social media perspective, this would screenshot well. It has enough personality that when you post your winning bet, the logo adds to the story. But I've also heard people say that tilted designs feel gimmicky. My colleague mentioned that her previous company tried a tilted logo and ended up straightening it because focus groups said it felt "trying too hard." So there's risk here.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Loud
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming app or entertainment platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It's aggressive, which some people think is confident and others think is overselling
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Bold text with outlines is definitely having a moment right now
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - When we're all betting together during a Premier League match, this energy level matches the atmosphere
C2. **Target audience:** People who bet with emotion and passion. My friends who shout at the TV during games would connect with this.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Everyone in my betting league would definitely notice this logo - it demands attention. The thick black outline makes it pop, which is important when you're scrolling through your phone looking for the app quickly. My friends and I are always in a hurry during matches, trying to place bets before the odds change, so visibility matters. The bold approach would fit well with how we talk about betting - confidently, sometimes loudly. But I think opinions would split on whether it's too much. Some people in my circle like bold and in-your-face, while others think that's compensating for something. My business partner says that brands that shout the loudest are often the ones with the least substance - his words, not mine. I don't necessarily agree, but that perspective exists in our network. From a social sharing standpoint, this would show up clearly in screenshots, which matters when we're posting our bets. But would it feel too aggressive over time? That's the question people would debate.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Sophisticated
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything - finance, luxury, consulting?
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - My friends would be confused about what this app actually does
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monograms are trendy, lots of brands are going minimal
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying to look premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This doesn't communicate betting or sports at all. People I know would walk right past this.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who care more about looking sophisticated than actually enjoying betting? Not our crowd.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I asked a few people in my network what they thought this logo was for when I saw it, and nobody guessed betting or gaming. One person said investment app, another said fashion brand, someone else thought consulting. That's a problem. When we're recommending apps to each other, we need to be able to say "look for the logo that looks like..." and have people find it. This is too abstract. My friend group appreciates clever design, but not when it sacrifices clarity. The monogram might appeal to a certain design-forward crowd, but most people I know who bet on sports want something more straightforward. We're looking for functionality and clear communication. This feels like it's designed for a different social circle - maybe more upscale, design-conscious users who would see the abstraction as sophisticated. But in my betting league? People would just be confused. Also, when you're sharing screenshots of your bets on social media, you want the logo to reinforce what you're doing. This doesn't tell a story or create context.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Modern
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment platform, maybe streaming or lifestyle
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - People I know would see this as professional and trustworthy
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - This is very current, matches what successful apps look like now
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with quality

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It works and looks good, but doesn't specifically say "sports betting" to my social circle
C2. **Target audience:** Younger professionals who want their apps to look polished. People like me and my colleagues.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Most people in my network would probably like this one. It has that clean, modern aesthetic that's popular right now. My colleagues in marketing would approve - it follows current design trends without being too aggressive or too boring. The lowercase approach feels friendly and approachable, which is important for social betting. When we're sharing the app with friends, you don't want it to feel intimidating or too serious. But here's the thing - it might be too subtle. A few people I've talked to about app logos say they want something with more personality, something that stands out in their mind. This is polished but almost forgettable. My girlfriend says it reminds her of every other minimal app she's downloaded lately - they all start to blend together. From a social proof perspective, it looks legitimate and professional, which matters when you're recommending it to friends. Nobody would question the credibility. But would they remember it? Would they talk about it? Probably not. It's the safe choice that everyone would accept but nobody would be excited about.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Playful
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app or casual gaming
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - My betting friends would think this looks too casual for real money
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script styles come and go in trends, this one feels a bit 2018
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This doesn't match what people in my circle expect from a betting platform
C2. **Target audience:** Super casual users, maybe teenage girls? Not our betting league demographic.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I can't see my betting group taking this seriously. The script style is too soft and playful for what we're doing. When you're putting real money on matches, you want the platform to feel substantial and reliable. This feels like a social media app or something for casual mobile games. People I know would probably question whether it's secure or professional enough. My friends are pretty direct - if something looks cheap or immature, they'll call it out. This would get called out. The script might work for a different social context, maybe a party planning app or something social and lighthearted. But for betting? We want to feel like winners, not like we're playing around. The aesthetics matter because they signal what kind of experience to expect. This signals casual and unserious. Nobody in my network would recommend this to their friends for sports betting. It's missing the edge and confidence that makes betting exciting.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gentle
A2. **What kind of company:** Kids' app or wellness brand
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - Everyone I know would immediately dismiss this as not serious
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Rounded styles are trending but this feels too soft
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, maybe even amateur

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This is completely wrong for betting. My entire social circle would laugh at this.
C2. **Target audience:** I honestly have no idea. Not anyone I know who bets on sports.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This would get roasted in our betting group chat. It's way too soft and friendly for sports betting. When we're all watching a match together and someone pulls out their betting app, it's part of the experience and social dynamic. You want your app to feel credible and respected. This looks like something for preschoolers or meditation. My friends would absolutely make fun of this if I tried to use it. The rounded letters and gentle style might work for certain apps - maybe something for relaxation or journaling. But betting is competitive and exciting, with risk and reward. This communicates none of that. From a social recommendation standpoint, I could never suggest this to my network. It would hurt my credibility. People would question my judgment. In our circle, the apps you use say something about you. This would say "I don't take betting seriously" or "I don't know what quality looks like." That might sound harsh, but that's the social reality. The logo needs to support the user's social identity, and this doesn't support the identity of anyone in the sports betting community I'm part of.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted stamp stands out because it's different from everything else. My friends and I notice things that break the pattern, and this definitely does. Whether that's good or bad, it's memorable because it sparked that internal debate about whether people would love it or hate it.

**Logo 4** - I remember this because it matches what most people in my network already associate with betting apps. It's familiar in the right way - confident and bold. That familiarity makes it stick because it aligns with social expectations.

**Logo 6** - I remember this one because of how wrong it felt. When something is that mismatched with the use case, it creates a strong negative memory. My immediate thought was "my friends would hate this," which makes it unforgettable, even though I'd never choose it.

The others (2, 3, 5, 7) are less distinct in my memory. Logo 2 is nice but blend-in territory. Logo 5 is bold but not distinctive enough from Logo 4. Logo 3 and 7 just don't connect with my social context, so they didn't stick strongly.
