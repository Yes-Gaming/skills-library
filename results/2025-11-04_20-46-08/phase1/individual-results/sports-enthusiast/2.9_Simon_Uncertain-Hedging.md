# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Professional, maybe?
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment platform, I think... or maybe lifestyle?
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It seems okay, but I'm not entirely sure. Looks professional enough, though.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - I think it's modern? It looks like other apps I've seen recently.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, probably

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It could work, I suppose. Not sure if it really says "betting" though.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people like me who are cautious? Or younger people? Hard to say.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I think the clean design is nice, and it doesn't look untrustworthy or anything. The lowercase letters are... fine? They seem friendly, which might be good, but I'm not certain if that's what you want from a betting app. Maybe it's too subtle? I worry that I might not recognize it easily on my phone, but then again, maybe I would get used to it. The gradients look decent, though I'm a bit concerned about whether the text is clear enough on some of the darker backgrounds. It's probably fine, but I can't be completely sure without testing it. Overall, it seems like a safe choice, but I'm not entirely confident about whether it's the right one.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Strong, I guess
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming app, maybe?
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The boldness makes me a bit nervous. Is it trying too hard?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Not sure if this is current or if it will look dated soon
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, possibly budget?

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - I suppose it has the energy you'd want, but maybe too much?
C2. **Target audience:** People who are more confident than me, probably. More aggressive bettors.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick black outline is... noticeable? I can see it clearly, which might be good, but it also feels a bit loud for my taste. I'm not sure if I'd want something this bold on my phone all the time. It might get annoying, or maybe I'd get used to it? Hard to say. The contrast is definitely strong, so I probably wouldn't have trouble seeing it, but I wonder if it's too aggressive. When I'm betting small amounts, I don't necessarily want the app to feel like it's shouting at me. But then again, maybe some people like that confidence? I just don't know if it's right for someone like me who's pretty cautious about betting. It might make me feel pressured, or maybe it would make me feel more confident? I'm really not certain.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confusing
A2. **What kind of company:** No idea, honestly. Could be anything.
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - I don't really understand it, which makes me uncertain about trusting it
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Maybe modern? I'm not good at judging these things.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying to be premium, I think?

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - I don't think this says "betting" at all. I'd probably be confused about what app this is.
C2. **Target audience:** People who like abstract design? Not me, probably.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I'm really not sure what to make of this one. The connected letters are... interesting? But I don't immediately see "YES" when I look at it. Maybe if someone explained it to me, I'd understand, but at first glance I'm just confused. For someone like me who's already nervous about betting, having an app I don't understand makes me more nervous. I'd probably skip over this one because I wouldn't be confident about what it does. Maybe some people think the abstraction is sophisticated, but I just find it unclear. When I'm carefully deciding whether to place a bet, I need things to be clear and straightforward, not puzzling. This might work for someone else, but probably not for me. Then again, maybe I'm just not getting it? I don't know.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Casual, maybe too casual?
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app or something light
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - It seems too informal for betting with real money
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - I think script styles might be a bit dated now? Not completely sure though.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - I'm not confident this is right for betting. Seems too playful.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe very casual users who don't bet much? People younger than me?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The script style makes me a bit uncomfortable for a betting app. It looks fun, which might be nice, but when I'm deciding whether to risk my money, I don't know if I want "fun" - maybe I want "secure" or "trustworthy"? But then again, maybe making it look friendly is good so I don't feel as anxious about betting? I go back and forth on this. The style seems a bit casual for handling money, but perhaps that's the point - to make it feel less serious and stressful? Though for someone like me who's already worried about responsible gambling, maybe too casual isn't good either? I'm really unsure. The script might also be hard to read at small sizes, which would be another concern. Overall, I don't think this is right for me, but I could be wrong about that.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Energetic, I think
A2. **What kind of company:** Sports or entertainment, maybe?
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The angle makes me feel a bit uncertain. Is it stable?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Could be current? Not entirely sure if the angle will age well.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It has energy, which might be appropriate? But the tilt makes me nervous.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who are more adventurous with their betting than I am

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted frame is definitely noticeable, which could be good or bad. I can see how it might stand out on my phone, which would help me find it, but the angle also makes me feel a bit uneasy. Is that weird? It's like the logo is unstable, and when I'm already nervous about betting money, I don't know if I want that feeling. But maybe I'm overthinking this. Some people probably see the angle as exciting and dynamic rather than unstable. I'm just not sure which interpretation is correct. The stamp style is interesting - it makes it look a bit collectible or special, which could be appealing. Or maybe it looks gimmicky? I really can't decide. For someone like me who's very cautious about gambling, I think I'd prefer something more straightforward and stable, but I could see how others might like this. I guess it depends on what kind of user they're targeting?

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Soft
A2. **What kind of company:** Maybe a wellness app or kids' app?
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - It seems too gentle for betting, but maybe that's comforting?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - I'm not sure if this style is current or not
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This doesn't seem right for betting, but I could be wrong
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users? People who want something non-threatening?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Part of me likes how gentle and non-threatening this looks - as someone who's nervous about gambling, having something that looks friendly rather than aggressive might help me feel less anxious. But another part of me thinks it's too soft and doesn't inspire confidence in the platform's professionalism. When I'm trusting an app with my money, even small amounts, I want it to seem capable and secure. This seems... nice? But maybe too nice? I'm worried it might not be taken seriously, or that it suggests the app itself isn't serious about security and responsible gambling. Then again, maybe making it friendly is exactly what anxious users like me need? I honestly can't decide. The rounded letters are probably easy to read, which is good, though I'm concerned about the text on some of those backgrounds - the yellow one especially seems hard to see. For someone in my position, uncertain about betting regularly, I think I need something that balances friendliness with professionalism, and I'm not sure this achieves that balance. But I could be completely wrong about this.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Powerful, maybe too powerful?
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or sports betting, probably
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The boldness suggests confidence, which could be good, but also might be overdone
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Not sure if shadows are still in style or becoming dated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - I think this probably fits the category, even though it's a bit bold for my taste
C2. **Target audience:** Confident bettors, people who bet more than I do

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The bold letters and shadow make this very strong and visible, which is probably good for functionality. I'd definitely be able to find it on my phone. But I'm not sure how I feel about the aggressive style. For someone like me who only bets small amounts occasionally, this might feel like it's designed for more serious gamblers. Would I feel comfortable using an app with a logo this bold? I don't know. Maybe I'd feel like I should be betting more than I do? Or maybe the confidence would rub off on me and make me feel better about my small bets? It's hard to say. The shadow effect adds depth, which makes it pop from the background - that's probably technically good. But I've heard people say that shadows are becoming dated as a design trend, so I worry this might look old in a year or two. Then again, maybe it's classic rather than trendy? I'm really not sure. Overall, it seems competent and professional, but I'm uncertain if it matches my cautious approach to betting.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 7** - I remember this one because I was so confused by it. When something doesn't make sense to me, it tends to stick in my mind because I keep trying to figure it out. Though I'm not sure if that's good - maybe being memorable for being confusing isn't the right kind of memorable?

**Logo 5** - The thick black outline stands out in my memory because it was so bold and loud. I'm still not sure if I like it, but I definitely remember it because of how strong it was. Maybe too strong? I can't decide.

**Logo 1** - The tilted angle made this memorable because it was different from the others. The angle made me uncertain, and that uncertainty makes it stick in my mind. I'm still not sure if the tilt is good or bad, but I remember it.

The others kind of blend together a bit - Logo 2 was nice but maybe too subtle, Logo 4 was bold but not distinctly different enough from Logo 5, and the script ones (3 and 6) both felt too casual in similar ways. I think? I'm not completely certain about that though.
