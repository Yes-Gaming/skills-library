# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Soft
A2. **What kind of company:** Kids' app or lifestyle brand
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too casual for handling money transactions
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The rounded style is current but execution feels weak
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Doesn't match what I need from a betting platform. Too lightweight.
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users, maybe people who've never bet before

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a functional standpoint, this has serious issues. The script style will lose legibility at app icon size - those connected letters need space to breathe, which you don't have at 60x60 pixels. The white text on yellow background fails contrast requirements for accessibility. That's not just aesthetic - it means users with visual impairments or in bright sunlight won't be able to read it properly. When I'm trying to place a quick bet before a match starts, I need immediate recognition. This would make me pause and squint. The rounded letterforms are too soft for the use case. Betting apps need to feel reliable and efficient. This feels uncertain. It's like using residential-grade equipment for industrial work - technically it functions, but it's not built for the job.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Clean
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment platform or streaming service
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - Professional execution suggests reliable backend systems
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Current design standards
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with quality engineering

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Works well. Clean interface suggests clean functionality.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who value efficiency and good design. Professional demographic.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is well-engineered from a visual systems perspective. The typography is consistent, the weight is balanced, the gradients are smooth. It would scale cleanly across different sizes and contexts - app icon, loading screen, push notifications. That consistency matters for user experience. You want the same visual reliability across all touchpoints. My only concern is contrast ratio on some of the darker gradient backgrounds. When it's on the deep blue or purple, the white text might not meet WCAG AAA standards. For quick recognition when I'm pulling out my phone to place a bet, I need high contrast. Functionally, the lowercase approach is smart - it's less aggressive, which means it won't feel intrusive as a persistent icon on my home screen. The refined letterforms will render clearly even at small sizes. From a usability perspective, it's solid. Does the job without getting in the way.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Unclear
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything - no immediate indication
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Abstraction creates uncertainty about functionality
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monogram approach is contemporary
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Attempting premium, achieving generic

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Doesn't communicate purpose. Fails basic information architecture principles.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who prioritize aesthetics over clarity? Not practical for quick task completion.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The primary function of an app icon is recognition and task association. This fails that test. When I'm looking at my phone screen, I need to instantly identify which app does what. The "YS" monogram doesn't clearly read as "YES" at first glance - there's cognitive processing required. That's friction. In engineering terms, it's like adding an unnecessary step to a process. The connected letterforms might cause rendering issues at small sizes - those thin connection points could disappear or create aliasing artifacts depending on screen resolution and pixel density. From a practical standpoint, this prioritizes design cleverness over functional clarity. That's backwards. The tool should serve the user, not make the user work to understand the tool. Additionally, the abstract nature means new users won't know what the app does from the icon alone. I'd have to remember through repetition rather than instant recognition. Inefficient design.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Solid
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or sports betting platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - Bold approach suggests confidence in the platform
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Shadow effect is functional but styling feels dated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Clear communication, appropriate energy level for the category
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream users who want straightforward functionality. No-nonsense bettors.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The high contrast between text and background ensures visibility across different lighting conditions - that's critical for mobile use. If I'm outside at a match trying to place a bet, I need to be able to see my screen clearly. This delivers that. The shadow adds depth, which helps the text pop from the background. From a functional perspective, that's good - increased legibility. However, the shadow adds visual complexity that might not render cleanly at very small sizes or low resolutions. It's an extra processing layer for the display to handle. The bold letterforms are efficient - you can read "YES" instantly without effort. That directness is good UX. Where this loses points is the shadow effect feeling like an aging design trend. It's functional now, but in 2-3 years it might look dated, which means the app would need rebranding. That's not efficient from a business operations perspective. Overall though, it works. It's clear, readable, and serves its purpose effectively.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Strong
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming app or entertainment platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Bold but almost aggressive. Functionality is there but personality might be too loud.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Bold approach is current
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Energy level matches category expectations. Communicates purpose clearly.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who want immediate, straightforward interaction. Quick decision makers.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick black outline ensures maximum visibility and contrast - from a pure functionality standpoint, this is effective. You could see this icon clearly from any angle, any distance, any lighting condition. That's good engineering. The outline also creates a clear boundary that would help it stand out among other apps on a screen. Practically useful. However, the heavy outline adds visual weight that might feel oppressive over time. When I'm using an app multiple times per day, I need the interface to feel balanced, not shouting at me every time. This is shouting. The outline is also redundant from a purely functional view - the bold text already has sufficient contrast against the gradient backgrounds. The extra border is adding emphasis that isn't needed for clarity. It's like over-engineering a solution - adding components that don't actually improve performance. That said, it works. The readability is excellent. The recognition factor is high. It does its job. But it could do the same job with less visual noise.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Angled
A2. **What kind of company:** Sports or entertainment brand
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The tilt adds energy but reduces stability perception
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Stamp style is current, execution is distinctive
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The energy fits the category. Dynamic visual matches dynamic activity.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who want personality in their apps. Younger demographic probably.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted frame is distinctive, which aids recognition - I'd spot this quickly on my home screen. That's functionally valuable. However, the angle creates an irregular footprint that won't align with standard app grid layouts. Most mobile operating systems organize icons on a perpendicular grid. This deliberately breaks that, which means it'll create visual tension with surrounding icons. That could make it stand out, or it could just feel disruptive. From a usability perspective, that's uncertain. The stamp style frame adds visual interest and helps contain the text element, creating a complete graphic unit. That's good design practice. The contrast is strong enough for clear visibility. But I question the long-term usability of the tilt. It's dynamic now, but will it cause user fatigue over time? When you're looking at something rotated slightly off-axis repeatedly, it can create subtle cognitive friction. Most interfaces are rectilinear for a reason - our spatial processing handles perpendicular lines more efficiently. This might be sacrificing efficiency for personality. Works well enough, but not optimized.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Casual
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app or lifestyle brand
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too informal for financial transactions
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts can work but this execution feels weak
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Personality doesn't match use case. Too lightweight for betting.
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users. Not for anyone who bets regularly or seriously.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Script typography has inherent functional problems at small scales. The connected letters and varying stroke widths lose definition when compressed to app icon size. You'd get muddiness and loss of legibility. That's a fundamental usability failure for a mobile app. The playful personality might work for some applications, but not for betting where users are making financial decisions. The visual language needs to support trust and reliability. This communicates casualness and fun, which is misaligned with user needs during task completion. From a practical engineering perspective, I also question how this would work across different contexts. On a dark mode interface, the script on dark backgrounds would be difficult to read. The gradient backgrounds shown here are bright, but apps need to work in multiple color schemes. This seems optimized for one specific presentation rather than systemic flexibility. The inconsistency between the soft, flowing script and the bold, graphic backgrounds also suggests poor design systems thinking. Functionally weak overall.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted frame is functionally distinctive. It's the only one that breaks the perpendicular orientation, which makes it stand out in memory through pattern disruption. From a recognition standpoint, that's effective even if it creates usability questions.

**Logo 2** - I remember this because of its clean execution. When something is well-engineered, it registers differently. The refinement stood out among the bolder options as being more systematically thought through.

**Logo 5** - The heavy black outline is memorable because it's the most aggressive approach to contrast and visibility. From a pure functionality standpoint, it's hard to forget something that's engineered to be this visible.

The script options (3 and 6) blurred together because they both have similar functional problems. The monogram (7) I remember because of its usability failure - confusion creates memory through negative association. Logo 4 works but doesn't distinguish itself enough - it's in the middle ground of effective but unremarkable.
