# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Commanding
A2. **What kind of company:** Professional sports betting platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - Bold and confident. This is a platform that knows what it's doing.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow effect is somewhat dated, but the overall execution is solid
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - Absolutely fits. This is exactly the confidence and impact a betting platform should convey.
C2. **Target audience:** Experienced bettors who know football inside out and want a platform that matches their expertise

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is a strong contender. The bold typography communicates confidence and decisiveness - exactly what I want from a betting platform. When I'm placing a bet, I'm making a calculated decision based on years of football knowledge, and this logo reflects that decisiveness. The shadow adds dimension and makes the text stand out clearly from the background. No ambiguity, no hesitation - just clear, bold communication. The contrast is excellent, which means functionality is solid. However, the shadow effect does feel like a design trend from 5-8 years ago. It works now, but I question its longevity. In consulting, we always think about 3-5 year strategies. Will this still feel current in that timeframe? Probably not. But for immediate impact and clear communication, this is effective. It knows what it is and doesn't apologize for it. I respect that.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Polished
A2. **What kind of company:** Premium entertainment platform
A3. **Trust level:** 5/5 - This is professional-grade design. Quality execution suggests quality platform.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Current design language. This is what best-in-class looks like right now.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with premium positioning

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - It works well, though it's less specifically "sports betting" and more broadly "entertainment"
C2. **Target audience:** Sophisticated users who expect quality design and smooth functionality. Professional demographic.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is the most professionally executed option. The typography is refined, the gradients are smooth, the overall system feels well-designed. As someone who evaluates platforms and services for a living, I can tell when something is built with attention to detail. This is. The lowercase approach is smart - it's confident without being aggressive. It says "yes" with assurance rather than shouting "YES" desperately. That maturity appeals to me. The only consideration is whether it's distinctive enough. It's excellent execution of current design trends, which means it looks like quality. But in a crowded market, does it stand out? That's a strategic question. For user experience, this is top-tier. For brand differentiation, it might need stronger personality. If I'm choosing based purely on design quality and sophistication, this is the clear winner. If I'm choosing based on memorability and impact, there might be stronger options.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Distinctive
A2. **What kind of company:** Action sports or dynamic entertainment brand
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Interesting choice, but the angle introduces unnecessary instability
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The stamp concept is current, execution is bold
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The energy and dynamism fit sports betting well
C2. **Target audience:** Users who want personality and energy in their platforms. Probably skews younger.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted frame is a clear differentiator - this would absolutely stand out in a competitive landscape. From a brand strategy perspective, differentiation has value. The stamp aesthetic is also interesting; it suggests authenticity and moment-capture, which could resonate with sports betting's "live moment" nature. That said, the tilt is a deliberate imperfection, and I have mixed feelings about that. In my work, precision matters. The angle creates visual tension that could be engaging or could be irritating depending on the user. It's a risk. The design also breaks conventional app grid alignment, which means it will always feel slightly disruptive on a home screen. Is that disruption valuable brand presence or annoying user friction? Depends on execution and context. I'd need to see this in actual usage to judge definitively. As a concept, it's bold. As a long-term brand asset, I'm not certain it's the optimal choice. But I respect the confidence it takes to tilt the frame.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Aggressive
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming app or sports platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The heavy outline feels like overcompensation
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Bold outlines are current but this execution is excessive
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market leaning budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It has energy but lacks sophistication
C2. **Target audience:** Casual bettors who respond to loud, obvious design. Not experienced professionals.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is trying too hard. The thick black outline is functionally unnecessary - the bold text already has sufficient contrast against the gradient backgrounds. Adding the heavy border is redundant emphasis. In business, overstatement often signals insecurity. When a platform has quality and substance, it doesn't need to shout. This is shouting. The visibility is excellent - I'll give it that. You could spot this from across a room. But at what cost? The aesthetic is blunt and unsophisticated. For someone like me who expects professional-grade platforms, this feels beneath my standards. It would work for a mass-market audience that responds to obvious, loud design. But I'm not that audience. I want confidence, not volume. The gradient backgrounds are decent, but the outlined text treatment undermines the overall sophistication. It's the weakest link. This logo doesn't trust itself, and if it doesn't trust itself, why should I trust the platform?

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Abstract
A2. **What kind of company:** Unclear - could be finance, consulting, fashion
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Abstraction creates ambiguity, which undermines confidence
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monogram approach is contemporary
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Attempting premium, achieving vague

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This doesn't communicate the category at all. Complete mismatch.
C2. **Target audience:** Design-forward users who prioritize aesthetics over clarity? Not sports bettors.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is a strategic misfire. The monogram is clever from a pure design perspective - the connected letterforms show craft and thought. But strategy isn't about being clever; it's about being effective. This fails the fundamental test of communication. When I look at this, I don't think "sports betting" or even "entertainment." I think "generic corporate brand." That's a problem. In consulting, we talk about clarity of value proposition. Your brand identity should immediately communicate what you do and why it matters. This communicates neither. The abstraction might appeal to a design committee, but not to users making quick decisions about which betting app to trust with their money. Additionally, the "YS" doesn't clearly read as "YES" - there's cognitive processing required to make that connection. In a competitive market where users make split-second decisions, that friction is fatal. This is design for design's sake rather than design for user needs. I'd reject this immediately in any strategic evaluation.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Casual
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app or lifestyle brand
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - Far too informal for financial transactions
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - Script fonts had their moment around 2016-2018
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Complete category mismatch. This doesn't work for betting at all.
C2. **Target audience:** Teenagers or very casual mobile game users. Nobody serious about betting.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is immediately disqualified. The script style is entirely wrong for a betting platform. When I'm placing bets worth hundreds or thousands of kroner based on my analysis of team performance, match conditions, and strategic factors, I need the platform to reflect that seriousness and expertise. This looks like a diary app or social planning tool. The playful script undermines credibility and professionalism. Beyond the obvious mismatch in tone, there are functional problems. Script typography loses legibility at small sizes, which is critical for app icons. The connected letters will muddy together when compressed. The flowing style also conflicts with the bold, geometric gradient backgrounds - the design language is inconsistent, which suggests poor strategic thinking in the brand development. This would never pass my evaluation criteria. It's not just wrong - it's obviously wrong. No serious bettor would choose this platform based on this identity. Rejected without hesitation.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Weak
A2. **What kind of company:** Children's app or wellness product
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - This inspires zero confidence in platform capability
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - Rounded script is trendy in some categories, but wrong here
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, possibly amateur

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 0/5 - This is categorically wrong. Completely inappropriate for betting.
C2. **Target audience:** I genuinely cannot identify who this would appeal to in the betting context. Nobody I know.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is the worst option by a significant margin. The rounded, gentle script is completely misaligned with sports betting's competitive, high-stakes nature. When I'm making strategic betting decisions based on comprehensive football knowledge, I need a platform that projects capability, security, and professionalism. This projects none of those qualities. It looks soft, amateur, and unserious. Beyond the tone mismatch, the functional execution is poor. The white text on yellow background fails basic contrast standards - that's not subjective design preference, that's objective usability failure. The rounded letterforms might work for a meditation app or children's educational product, but for betting? Absolutely not. This would damage the platform's credibility in the market. If I saw this logo on an app store, I wouldn't even investigate further. It would be eliminated instantly as not meeting professional standards. The gap between what this communicates and what a betting platform needs to communicate is massive. This is a fundamental strategic failure.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 2** - This stands out in memory because of its professional execution quality. When something is done well, it registers differently. The refinement and sophistication made it memorable as the premium option.

**Logo 4** - The bold, shadowed text is memorable because it takes a clear, confident position. It's not trying to be everything to everyone - it knows exactly what it is. That clarity makes it stick.

**Logo 1** - The tilted frame is impossible to forget because it's the only one that breaks the perpendicular orientation. Whether that's strategically smart is debatable, but it's definitely distinctive and memorable.

The others are memorable for negative reasons or blend together. Logo 5 tries too hard, Logos 3 and 6 are wrong for the category, and Logo 7 is too abstract. Logo 2 and 4 are memorable because they're actually good at different things - 2 for sophistication, 4 for impact.
