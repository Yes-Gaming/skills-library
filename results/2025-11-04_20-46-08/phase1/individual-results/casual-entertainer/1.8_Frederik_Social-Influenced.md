# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confident
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or sports app - something people would post about
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It's solid but everyone's using similar styles these days
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow thing was big a few years ago, feels a bit 2019
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, nothing special

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Yeah, it fits. I see this kind of branding in gaming content all the time
C2. **Target audience:** Casual gamers, people who just want straightforward fun. My friends who aren't too picky about design.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The bold text is the kind of thing that would be easy to screenshot and share if you won something. Like, I can see this working in Instagram stories. But honestly, most people in my network are moving toward cleaner, more minimal aesthetics. The shadow effect feels like what brands were doing when I first started in social media. It's not bad, just not exciting. People wouldn't really talk about this logo specifically - it does the job but doesn't create conversations.

## LOGO 1 (Bold "YES" in tilted rectangular stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Energetic
A2. **What kind of company:** This could be trendy - gives me festival or event vibes
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The personality is good, people like brands with character
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The tilted sticker aesthetic is very Instagram-story-sticker vibes
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market but fun

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Yeah, this works. It's got that "let's go" energy people respond to
C2. **Target audience:** Young social users like my friend group. People who share their wins and experiences.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Everyone in my network loves sticker aesthetics - we use them constantly on Instagram and Snapchat. This logo taps into that visual language, which is smart. I could see people actually wanting to engage with a brand that uses this. The angle makes it feel dynamic, like something is happening. But my friends who are really into clean minimal design might find it too busy. I think most people would like it though - it's got personality without being too crazy. It's the kind of logo people might actually mention when recommending the app.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase "yes" script friendly style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Soft
A2. **What kind of company:** Maybe a wellness app? Everyone's talking about mental health apps lately
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too gentle for betting. People I know want their gaming apps to feel more substantial
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Rounded fonts are everywhere but this feels a bit basic
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, not something people would brag about using

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Wrong vibe completely. Everyone's looking for either sleek or bold, not this
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who are super casual and don't care about the social aspect?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The rounded style is friendly, which could work for some brands, but for gaming? People in my friend group want to feel like they're using something cool or sophisticated, not something that looks like a kids' app. The white on yellow is terrible for screenshots - if someone wanted to share a win on their story, this would be hard to read. Social media is huge for gaming apps now, and this doesn't think about shareability at all. People wouldn't want to post about using this.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined, clean, modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Sophisticated
A2. **What kind of company:** Tech platform, something people would actually want on their phone
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - Clean design suggests professional company. People trust polished brands
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - This is exactly what's trending right now. Everyone's going minimal
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Premium vibes, mass-market price point probably

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It's well-designed but could be any app honestly
C2. **Target audience:** Design-conscious millennials and Gen Z. People who care what their phone screen looks like. My Instagram followers would approve of this.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is the kind of logo that would look good in screenshots and social posts - clean, minimal, aesthetically pleasing. People in my network definitely value that. It's Instagram-worthy, which matters more than companies realize. My friends would be more likely to recommend an app that looks this good. However, I think some people might say it doesn't stand out enough - in a crowded app store or in someone's phone full of apps, it might blend in. But the people I know would prefer this over something loud. It's got that "I have good taste" factor.

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive "Yes" playful style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Fun
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app maybe? Creative platform?
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too playful for betting. Most people I know want more credibility
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts are hit or miss, this one feels a bit young
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, very casual

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Wrong energy for gaming. People want excitement or sophistication, not cuteness
C2. **Target audience:** Really young casual users? Not the people I know who actually engage with gaming content

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The colorful backgrounds are vibrant, which I appreciate from a social media perspective. But the script font feels too informal for an app where you're spending money. People in my network talk about trusting brands, and this doesn't communicate trustworthiness. Also, script fonts are hard to read at small sizes, which means it wouldn't work well in social shares or mobile screenshots. Everyone's screenshotting and sharing now, so that matters. My friends would probably think this is trying too hard to be cute.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Bold
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile gaming, casual entertainment
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Straightforward, which people appreciate, but nothing special
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The heavy outline is very app-store aesthetic right now
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, accessible

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - It works for the category. I've seen similar styles in gaming communities
C2. **Target audience:** General casual gamers. People who just want something simple and don't overthink it.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick outline makes it very visible, which is good for app icons. People scrolling through their phones would spot this easily. It's confident without being too aggressive. But honestly, I think most people in my network would find it a bit basic - it's functional but not inspiring. It wouldn't generate buzz or word-of-mouth. People would use it but not talk about it. In social media terms, it's fine but forgettable. My friends want apps they can get excited about and recommend, and this is just... there.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram - abstract connected letterforms)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confused
A2. **What kind of company:** No idea - could be anything
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - When I can't tell what something is, I don't trust it. People I know feel the same
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monograms are having a moment
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying to be premium but missing the mark

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Doesn't communicate the category at all
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who want to feel exclusive? But everyone I know would just be confused

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** People in my network value clarity and instant recognition. This fails that test completely. The "YS" doesn't immediately read as "YES," which means cognitive friction. In the social media world, you have about 2 seconds to capture attention - this would lose people in that time. Also, when someone asks "what app are you using?" and you have to explain what the logo means, that's a problem. Word-of-mouth marketing relies on easy communication, and this logo makes it harder. My friends would probably just call it "that gambling app" instead of remembering the name because the logo doesn't help. Not shareable, not memorable for the right reasons.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 2** - The refined minimal one. Everyone in my network appreciates clean design, so it stuck with me. It's the one I'd be most likely to recommend to friends.

**Logo 1** - The tilted stamp/sticker style. It's distinctive and taps into visual language people are already using on social media. Would stand out in conversations.

**Logo 7** - I remember it because it confused me, which made my brain work harder. But that's not positive memorability - it's the kind of thing people would complain about in friend groups.

The bold ones (4, 5) blur together because they're both just... bold text. Nothing particularly social about them. Logo 3 and 6 are both script styles that feel wrong for the category, so they merge in my memory as "the ones that don't fit."

From a social influence perspective, I remember the ones that would either get positive recommendations (Logo 2 for aesthetics, Logo 1 for personality) or negative word-of-mouth (Logo 7 for confusion). The others just wouldn't generate conversation.
