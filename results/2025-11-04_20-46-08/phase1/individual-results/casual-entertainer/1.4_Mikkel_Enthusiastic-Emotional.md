**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The script is playful and has personality! I like that it's different from the bold ones! The colorful backgrounds are fun! But I'm not sure it has enough punch for a gaming app - it's a bit too soft? Like it's friendly but maybe needs more energy? Still, it makes me feel good when I look at it!

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

C2. **Target audience:** People who care more about looking cool than having fun? Not my vibe!

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I appreciate that they tried something different with the monogram, but I can't read it quickly! When I'm looking at my phone after work, I need to spot my apps fast! This makes me work too hard to figure out what it says! The connected letters look cool in theory, but in practice, it's just confusing! Not feeling the energy from this one!

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase "yes" script)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gentle
A2. **What kind of company:** Wellness app or something calm

A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Way too mellow for gaming! Where's the energy? Where's the thrill?
C2. **Target audience:** People who want something super safe and non-threatening? Not the party crowd!

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The rounded letters are nice and friendly, but that's the problem - it's TOO friendly for gaming! When I'm playing after a shift at the club, I want something that keeps my energy up, not something that looks like a meditation app! The yellow version is especially hard to read! It's just not giving me the buzz I want from a gaming app! Feels like it's for a totally different vibe!

It's got that punch!

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted stamp is SO memorable! That angle makes it completely unique! Can't forget it!

**Logo 5** - The bold outline stands out so much! The heavy black line makes it pop in my memory!

**Logo 2** - Remember this one because it was the most refined and stylish! The clean look stuck with me!

The others kind of blur together a bit - Logo 4 was bold like Logo 5 but the shadow isn't as distinctive as the outline. Logos 3 and 6 were both scripts that felt too soft. Logo 7 confused me so I remember being confused more than I remember the actual design.

The ones with the most energy and personality are the ones that stick! Logo 1's angle, Logo 5's outline, Logo 2's sophistication - these have clear identities! When something has strong personality, it stays in your mind! That's what makes a logo work!
