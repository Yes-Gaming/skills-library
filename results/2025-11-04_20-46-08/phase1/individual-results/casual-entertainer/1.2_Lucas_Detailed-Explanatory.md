# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase "yes" script)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Approachable
A2. **What kind of company:** Consumer app, maybe wellness or lifestyle
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Well, I think the reason my trust is low is because when you look at it, the rounded script feels too informal for a platform that handles financial transactions. The typography doesn't communicate the security and professionalism you'd want from a betting platform.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The rounded script style has been trending, but it feels like it's already on its way out. It's that safe, friendly aesthetic that was popular around 2019-2020.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - When you think about iGaming, you want energy, excitement, and confidence. This script is too passive. It's the kind of typography you'd see on a meditation app or a children's educational product, not something where real money is at stake.
C2. **Target audience:** I'd say this would appeal to extremely casual users who are risk-averse and might be intimidated by bold gaming aesthetics. Maybe first-time users who need something non-threatening, but that's a narrow segment.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a design perspective, the letterforms are technically well-executed - the rounded terminals are consistent, the weight distribution is even. But the problem is the personality it projects. The script style with those soft, bubbly curves communicates "safe" and "gentle," which is completely wrong for the category. Also, from a UX standpoint, script typography has legibility issues at small sizes. When this scales down to an app icon, those connected letters will lose definition. The contrast on some of those background variations is poor too - especially the yellow, which would fail WCAG accessibility standards.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Impactful
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform, probably casual games or betting
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The boldness suggests confidence, which is good, but the shadow effect feels a bit dated. It's that early 2010s design trend where designers added shadows to create dimension. It works to make the logo pop, but it feels like a technique from a previous era.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The all-caps bold type is timeless, but the shadow treatment specifically dates it. Shadows like this were really popular around 2010-2015.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The bold, impactful nature fits the category well. When you're designing for gaming or betting, you want that sense of confidence and energy, and the strong letterforms deliver that. The shadow adds a sense of dimension that makes it feel more tactile and less flat.
C2. **Target audience:** I think this would resonate with mainstream casual gamers - people who want something straightforward and powerful without being too aggressive or edgy. It skews slightly male in perception because of the bold, heavy treatment.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** What works is the high contrast and bold letterforms - these ensure good legibility at any size, which is critical for app icons and mobile interfaces. The white text on those vibrant gradients creates strong visual hierarchy. What doesn't work as well is the shadow effect itself. While it adds depth, it feels redundant - the gradient backgrounds already provide visual interest. The shadow adds complexity without adding value, and at very small sizes, it might not render cleanly. From a design evolution standpoint, we've moved away from these heavy shadow effects toward flatter, cleaner designs or more sophisticated depth techniques like long shadows or subtle glows.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Sophisticated
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment platform, maybe streaming or lifestyle tech
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - This feels polished and professional. The refinement in the typography suggests the company cares about design quality and attention to detail, which builds trust. When you see clean, well-executed design, you infer that the same care goes into the product itself.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very modern. The lowercase, minimal approach is very current in 2025. It follows the design language we're seeing from major tech platforms - clean, confident, uncluttered.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with premium aspirations

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - Here's where it gets interesting. From a pure design perspective, this is excellent. But from a category-fit perspective, it's somewhat generic. It doesn't immediately signal "gaming" or "entertainment" - it could just as easily be a fintech app, a social platform, or a productivity tool. The clean sophistication works broadly, which might be intentional for a brand positioning strategy, but it lacks the category-specific signals that would immediately communicate what the app does.
C2. **Target audience:** This would appeal to design-conscious users - younger millennials and Gen Z who value aesthetics and want their apps to look good on their home screen. These are users who appreciate minimalism and sophistication over flashiness.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a design craft perspective, this is the best-executed logo of what I've seen. The typography is refined, the gradients are more sophisticated and subtle compared to others, and the overall composition is balanced. The lowercase approach is less aggressive and more modern than all-caps alternatives. However, there's a functional concern - at app icon size, the thin strokes and subtle gradients might lose impact. The contrast between the white text and some of those darker gradient backgrounds could cause legibility issues at 60x60 or 120x120 pixels. I'd want to see this tested at actual icon sizes. Also, the minimalism might make it harder to spot quickly when scanning a home screen full of apps - it could blend in rather than stand out, which is a consideration for discoverability.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or entertainment, possibly event ticketing or activation platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The tilted angle gives it personality and energy, but from a psychological standpoint, angles and instability can subtly communicate lack of reliability. It's an interesting design tension - the angle makes it memorable but might unconsciously affect trust perception.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The stamp/sticker aesthetic is definitely trending right now. We're seeing a lot of brands embrace these badge-like, rotated design elements.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The energy and boldness fit the category well. The angle suggests action, movement, and excitement, which aligns with gaming and entertainment. It has personality, which helps in a crowded market.
C2. **Target audience:** I'd say this appeals to casual gamers who want something fun and unpretentious - probably skewing younger, maybe 20-30. Users who appreciate a bit of playfulness and don't want something too corporate or serious.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** What works really well is distinctiveness. The tilted rectangular frame is a strong differentiator - it creates a unique shape that would be instantly recognizable on a home screen. That's valuable from a brand recognition standpoint. The bold contrast between the black frame and vibrant backgrounds ensures visibility. What doesn't work as well is the practical application - the angled footprint creates an awkward shape that doesn't tile neatly with other app icons. Most mobile interfaces are designed around a grid system, and this deliberately breaks that. It might look dynamic in isolation, but in context with other square icons, it could feel disruptive or create visual tension. There's also the psychological angle concern I mentioned - while it's energetic, tilt can subconsciously suggest instability, which isn't ideal for a platform handling money.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Abstract
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything - finance, fitness, fashion, tech. The abstraction makes it category-agnostic.
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The reason my trust is lower is because the abstraction creates uncertainty. When I can't immediately understand what a company does from its logo, it affects my confidence. There's cognitive friction between seeing the mark and understanding its meaning.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monograms and abstract letterforms are definitely modern design trends. This follows current practices in logo design.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying to be premium but landing at mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This is where the abstraction really hurts it. There's nothing about these connected letterforms that communicates gaming, entertainment, or betting. A logo's primary job is to communicate brand identity and category at a glance, and this doesn't do that. It's so generic it could be applied to almost any industry.
C2. **Target audience:** This would appeal to users who prioritize sophistication and design over immediate clarity. Maybe an older, more affluent demographic who associates abstraction with premium quality. But that's a limited segment.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a pure design craft perspective, the monogram is technically competent - the letterforms connect in an elegant way, the weight is consistent. But from a functional UX perspective, this fails the primary test of logo design: immediate recognition and communication. When I'm scrolling through my phone looking for an app, I need to recognize it instantly. The "YS" doesn't clearly spell "YES" at first glance - there's a moment of cognitive processing required, and that's friction. Also, at small icon sizes, those thin connecting lines might not render well, potentially losing the integrity of the design. The connected letterforms could merge into an illegible blob at 60x60 pixels. This logo prioritizes sophistication over functionality, which is the wrong trade-off for a mobile-first gaming app.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Loud
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming app or mobile entertainment platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The boldness works and communicates confidence, but the heavy black outline feels a bit aggressive. It's almost shouting at you. It doesn't feel untrustworthy, but it doesn't inspire trust either - it's more neutral.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The bold, outlined style is modern and follows current trends in app design where high contrast and clear silhouettes are valued for icon legibility.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, leaning toward budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - It fits the category because the bold colors and strong contrast communicate energy and excitement, which aligns with gaming. The outline creates a clear silhouette that would work well in various contexts.
C2. **Target audience:** Young, mobile-first users who want something straightforward and energetic. Probably casual gamers rather than serious bettors - the aesthetic is more playful than professional.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** What works extremely well is visibility and legibility. That thick black outline creates a strong silhouette that ensures this logo would be readable at any size, in any context. From a functional UX perspective, that's valuable - whether it's a tiny favicon, an app icon, or a large banner, this will maintain clarity. The high contrast between the white text, black outline, and vibrant backgrounds ensures it pops. What doesn't work as well is subtlety - the heavy outline feels excessive, like it's trying too hard to stand out. It has a slightly aggressive quality that might not appeal to all demographics. The outline adds visual weight that makes the overall mark feel heavier and less refined than it could be. It's functional but not elegant. The gradients are fairly standard and don't add much sophistication. This logo prioritizes visibility over sophistication, which might be the right choice for mass-market casual gaming, but it limits its premium appeal.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Playful
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app, lifestyle brand, or consumer product
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The script feels too casual for a platform handling financial transactions. When I see script typography in this context, I think "informal" and "lighthearted," which doesn't inspire confidence when real money is involved.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts can feel either trendy or dated depending on execution. This one feels like it's from around 2016-2018 when this particular script style was really popular. It's not dramatically dated, but it's not cutting-edge either.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This feels wrong for the category. The script is too friendly and lightweight for an industry that involves real money and betting. It lacks the gravitas and confidence you'd want from a gaming platform. This might work for a social gaming app with virtual currency, but not for real-money betting.
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users, possibly younger teens or users who want something non-intimidating. Not serious players or anyone with significant gambling experience.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a design analysis perspective, script typography is fundamentally problematic at small sizes. The connected letters and varying stroke widths create complexity that loses definition when scaled down. At app icon size (60x60 or 120x120 pixels), this would lose legibility - the delicate connections and flourishes would merge together. That's a critical functional flaw. Beyond the technical issues, there's a deeper brand mismatch. The solid, vibrant backgrounds have a bold, graphic quality, while the script typography is soft, flowing, and organic. These two design languages don't work together - it's like mixing a punk rock aesthetic with classical calligraphy. The design lacks internal consistency, which suggests the user experience might be similarly inconsistent. For a gaming platform, you want design that communicates energy, confidence, and reliability. This script communicates friendliness and casualness, which is the wrong message when users are trusting you with their money.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted rectangular frame is the most distinctive design element I've seen. It's the only logo with that angled approach, which makes it highly memorable. From a cognitive psychology perspective, distinctiveness drives recall, and that angle creates uniqueness.

**Logo 2** - This stuck with me because it felt the most professionally executed from a design craft perspective. When something is done particularly well, it tends to be memorable. The refinement and sophistication made it stand out among the bolder options.

**Logo 5** - The heavy black outline creates such a strong visual signature that it's hard to forget. The extreme contrast and bold silhouette make it very recognizable, even if it's not the most elegant solution.

The others - Logos 3, 4, 6, and 7 - tend to blur together in my memory. Logos 3 and 6 are both scripts with similar friendly personalities, so they compete for the same mental space. Logo 4 is bold like Logo 5 but less distinctive because the shadow effect isn't as unique as the outline. Logo 7's abstraction makes it memorable in the sense that I remember being confused by it, but I don't remember it positively - I remember the cognitive friction it created rather than the design itself.

From a branding perspective, the logos I remember best are the ones with the strongest differentiating features - whether that's the angle, the refinement, or the heavy outline. The ones I forget are those that feel like variations on familiar themes without a unique hook.
