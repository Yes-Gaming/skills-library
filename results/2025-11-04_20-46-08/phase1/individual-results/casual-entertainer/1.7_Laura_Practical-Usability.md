# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined, clean, modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Clean
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment app, possibly streaming or social media
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - Professional appearance suggests competent backend
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very current design language
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market leaning premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - Functionally works, but doesn't specifically communicate gaming
C2. **Target audience:** Users who value design quality and clean interfaces

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a usability standpoint, the clean typography is good - easy to read, no visual clutter. However, I'm concerned about visibility at small sizes. On my bus commute, I need to find apps quickly on my phone screen. The white text on some of those darker gradient backgrounds might create readability issues, especially in bright sunlight on the bus. The contrast ratio matters for practical use. Otherwise, it's well-executed but might be too subtle for quick recognition.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Functional
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile gaming app
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Straightforward, not trying to hide anything
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Current app aesthetic
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Clear communication of category
C2. **Target audience:** Casual users who want simple, accessible entertainment

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick black outline serves a clear purpose - maximum contrast for visibility. On the bus during my commute, this would be easy to spot on my phone screen. That's important when I only have a 25-minute ride and want to start playing quickly. The bold lettering is readable at any size. But the design feels heavy-handed - the outline is thicker than necessary for functionality. It's doing the job, but not elegantly. It's like medical equipment that works perfectly but looks clunky. Effective, not refined.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram - abstract connected letterforms)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Unclear
A2. **What kind of company:** Can't tell - too abstract
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Lack of clarity reduces confidence
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monogram approach is contemporary
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Attempting premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Doesn't communicate purpose
C2. **Target audience:** Uncertain - the abstraction doesn't clearly signal who this is for

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a practical perspective, this fails the quick-recognition test. On my phone, I need immediate identification. This requires cognitive processing to decode "YES" from "YS" - that's wasted time and mental effort. During my short bus commute, every second counts. The connected letterforms might look sophisticated, but they prioritize aesthetics over usability. Also concerned about how those thin connecting lines would render at small app icon size - they might break up or become invisible. Not user-friendly.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Strong
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or sports betting
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Confident presentation
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Shadow effect feels slightly dated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Appropriate energy for the category
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream users who want straightforward gaming

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The bold typography ensures good readability - that's the most important functional requirement. The shadow adds depth, which helps it stand out, but I question whether it's necessary. From a usability perspective, the shadow adds visual complexity that might not render cleanly at very small sizes. During my 15-minute breaks at work, I need apps that load fast and are immediately recognizable. The core bold text does that job; the shadow is decorative rather than functional. It works, but there's room for simplification.

## LOGO 1 (Bold "YES" in tilted rectangular stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or entertainment events
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Energetic but possibly unstable-feeling
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Tilted stamp aesthetic is current
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Energy level matches category well
C2. **Target audience:** Young casual players who want fun, not formality

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted angle creates distinction, which is good for recognition - I'd spot this quickly on my phone. However, from a practical standpoint, the angled frame creates an awkward footprint. Apps are designed to sit in a grid, and this deliberately breaks that alignment. On my home screen, it might look visually disruptive next to all my other standard-aligned icons. There's a usability tradeoff between "distinctive" and "harmonious." The bold contrast is excellent for readability though. It's memorable but potentially annoying in daily use.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase "yes" script friendly style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gentle
A2. **What kind of company:** Wellness app or children's content
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too informal for financial transactions
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Safe but unremarkable
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Wrong tone for the category
C2. **Target audience:** Very risk-averse users, possibly too casual

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The rounded letterforms are legible, which is positive. But functionally, this sends the wrong signals. When I'm using an app that involves real money - even just small amounts during my commute - I want the interface to feel capable and professional. This feels too lightweight. The white text on yellow background is a major usability problem - extremely poor contrast that would be difficult to read in various lighting conditions on the bus. That's a basic accessibility failure. The script style also has the readability concern at small sizes. Not practical for actual use.

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive "Yes" playful style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Playful
A2. **What kind of company:** Lifestyle brand or creative app
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too casual for betting
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script can feel trendy or dated depending
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Mismatched tone for money transactions
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users, maybe younger demographic

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a practical usability perspective, script typography is problematic. The connected letters and varying stroke widths will lose definition at app icon size. On my phone screen, this would be hard to read quickly. The colorful backgrounds are vibrant, but they clash with the soft script style - there's no consistency in the design language. When I have limited time during breaks or commutes, I need interfaces that are immediately clear and easy to navigate. This creates cognitive friction. Also concerned about how this renders on different screen resolutions and in different lighting conditions. Not functional enough for practical daily use.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 2** - The refined lowercase version. Clean, professional, easy to process visually.

**Logo 1** - The tilted frame is distinctive. Immediate visual differentiation from standard app icons.

**Logo 5** - The thick black outline. Highly visible and functional, even if aesthetically heavy.

From a practical standpoint, I remember the ones that either maximize usability (Logo 2, Logo 5) or create strong visual distinction (Logo 1). The script variations (3, 6) blur together because they both present similar readability challenges. Logo 7 stands out for the wrong reason - confusion rather than clarity. Logo 4 is competent but unmemorable - it does the job without creating a strong impression.

Functionally speaking, the most important factor for recall is whether I can quickly identify the app when I need it. That means clear typography, good contrast, and distinctive visual elements that work at small sizes.
