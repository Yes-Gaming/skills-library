## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted one stands out because it's different

**Logo 5** - Bold with the outline, easy to remember

**Logo 2** - Clean and simple, liked it

The others didn't stick with me much. The script ones (3 and 6) were too similar and forgettable. The monogram (7) confused me.
