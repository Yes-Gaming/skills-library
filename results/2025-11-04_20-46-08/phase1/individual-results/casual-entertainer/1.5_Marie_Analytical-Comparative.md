# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Professional
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment or tech platform, likely with multi-product offerings
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - Looking at the options comparatively, this appears more trustworthy due to its refined execution. The clean typography suggests attention to detail, which typically correlates with operational quality.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - This aligns with current 2025 design trends toward minimalism and clarity
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with premium positioning aspirations

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - If we compare this to typical gaming aesthetics, it's more subdued. It could work across multiple entertainment categories, which suggests strategic flexibility but potentially lacks category-specific signaling.
C2. **Target audience:** Demographics that value design quality and sophistication - likely 25-40, higher education, appreciates aesthetic refinement

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From an analytical perspective, this represents the highest execution quality in terms of typography and refinement. The lowercase approach reduces visual aggression compared to all-caps alternatives, which could appeal to broader demographics including risk-averse segments. The gradients are more sophisticated than standard linear progressions. However, the data suggests a potential legibility concern: at small scales (60x60px icon size), the contrast ratios between light text and darker gradient backgrounds may fall below optimal recognition thresholds. The minimalism trades impact for sophistication - whether that trade-off benefits the brand depends on target acquisition channels and competitive positioning strategy.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Abstract
A2. **What kind of company:** Unclear category positioning - could be finance, tech, fashion, or consulting
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The abstraction creates information asymmetry. When a logo doesn't clearly communicate category or purpose, it increases cognitive load and reduces trust through uncertainty.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monogram approaches are currently trending in logo design
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Attempting premium positioning through abstraction

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - If we analyze category-fit metrics, this scores low. There are no visual signals that communicate gaming, entertainment, or betting. The abstraction makes it category-agnostic, which is a strategic weakness for brand recognition.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who prioritize aesthetic sophistication over functional clarity - likely smaller, more design-conscious segment

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Looking at this comparatively, the monogram represents an interesting strategic choice that prioritizes sophistication over clarity. From a data perspective, this creates higher cognitive friction - the time-to-recognition will be longer, which impacts app store browsing behavior and home screen navigation efficiency. The connected letterforms don't clearly spell "YES" on first viewing, requiring additional cognitive processing. At scale, this matters: if we assume average app store browse time of 1-2 seconds per icon, logos requiring additional processing time convert at lower rates. The technical concern is line weight at small sizes - those connecting elements may not render distinctly at 60x60px, potentially degrading into an illegible shape. The abstraction might work for desktop or print applications but appears suboptimal for mobile-first use cases.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** High-contrast
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile gaming or entertainment platform emphasizing visibility
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The bold approach communicates confidence, but the heavy outline creates visual aggression that could reduce trust in more conservative segments
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - High-contrast outlined approaches are currently used in mobile-first design
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, potentially skewing budget due to visual weight

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Comparing across options, this fits gaming aesthetics well. The bold, high-energy visual aligns with category expectations.
C2. **Target audience:** Mobile-first casual gamers prioritizing visibility and clarity over sophistication - likely 18-35 demographic

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a functional analysis, this logo optimizes for visibility and legibility at all scales. The thick black outline creates maximum contrast ensuring recognition across contexts - app stores, home screens, small icons, notifications. This is a data-driven design choice prioritizing functional performance. The silhouette strength is high, meaning even at very small sizes or in challenging visibility conditions, this remains recognizable. However, the visual weight creates a trade-off: while legibility increases, perceived sophistication decreases. If we segment the market, this appeals strongly to casual, mobile-first users but likely underperforms with older or more affluent demographics who may perceive the heavy outline as unsophisticated. The gradient backgrounds are standard rather than refined. This logo maximizes one variable (visibility) at the expense of others (sophistication, trust from premium segments).

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dimensional
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform utilizing depth effects
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The shadow effect adds visual weight that suggests confidence, but the technique feels dated based on design trend analysis
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Shadow effects peaked in popularity circa 2010-2015; current trend data shows movement away from this approach
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The bold, impactful style aligns well with gaming category conventions. The shadow creates emphasis that fits high-energy entertainment.
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream users who respond to bold, straightforward design - likely broad demographic appeal but stronger with male users based on boldness preference data

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Comparing this to Logo 5, both use bold all-caps "YES" but apply different enhancement techniques - outline vs. shadow. From a functional perspective, the shadow adds depth but creates rendering complexity at small sizes. The shadow effect requires more pixels to render clearly, which may cause definition loss at icon scales. The technique itself shows higher popularity in 2010-2015 design trend data compared to current 2025 standards, suggesting dated perception among design-conscious segments. However, for mainstream users less attuned to design trends, this likely still communicates impact effectively. The high contrast between white text and vibrant backgrounds ensures legibility. The gradients are standard quality. Overall, this optimizes for immediate impact but may sacrifice longevity as the shadow technique continues to date.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or entertainment platform emphasizing energy and movement
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The angle creates visual interest but potentially undermines stability perception. Research suggests angled elements can unconsciously signal instability or unreliability.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Stamp/badge aesthetics with rotation are currently trending in 2024-2025
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The energy and boldness fit gaming well. The angle suggests action and excitement, which aligns with category positioning.
C2. **Target audience:** Younger demographics (20-32) who appreciate distinctive, energetic design over conservative approaches

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a comparative analysis, this is the most distinctive design due to the tilted frame - it's the only logo utilizing rotation as a primary differentiator. From a recognition perspective, this creates high memorability through uniqueness. However, there are functional concerns: the angled footprint creates a non-standard shape that doesn't align with typical icon grid systems. Most mobile interfaces use square or rounded-square icons on precise grids - this tilted rectangle creates visual disruption. Looking at data on icon recognition, distinctiveness drives recall, which favors this approach. But analyzing user interface harmony, the angle creates friction with surrounding elements. There's also the psychological angle: research in visual perception suggests rotated elements can trigger subtle instability associations, which is suboptimal for platforms handling financial transactions. The risk-reward analysis: high recognition value but potential trust reduction in security-conscious segments.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Casual
A2. **What kind of company:** Social platform or lifestyle brand with friendly positioning
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Script typography typically correlates with informal, casual associations that reduce perceived trustworthiness in financial transaction contexts
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts trend cyclically; this particular style appears to be from 2016-2018 trend peak
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Comparing to category norms, script typography is anomalous in gaming/betting sectors. The casual aesthetic contradicts the confidence and energy typically associated with successful gaming brands.
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users seeking non-threatening, friendly experiences - potentially first-time or risk-averse players

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Analyzing this comparatively, the script represents the lowest formality level across all options. From a strategic perspective, this could serve a specific positioning need if targeting users intimidated by typical gaming aesthetics. However, the data suggests this is a narrow segment. Functionally, script typography presents technical challenges: connected letterforms with varying stroke widths lose definition at small scales. The legibility threshold for script fonts is higher than sans-serif alternatives - testing would likely show reduced recognition at 60x60px icon size. There's also a brand message contradiction: the bold, graphic backgrounds communicate energy and impact, while the soft script communicates gentleness and casualness. These conflicting signals create brand confusion. If we look at successful gaming brands, they consistently use bold, clear typography that communicates confidence. This script approach appears to be a strategic mismatch for the category.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase "yes" script)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Soft
A2. **What kind of company:** Wellness, meditation, or children's application based on the gentle aesthetic
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The excessive softness reduces confidence in platform capability, particularly for financial transactions
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Rounded, friendly typography trends in specific categories but feels generic in execution
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - If we compare this to successful gaming brands, there's clear category mismatch. The gentle, non-threatening aesthetic contradicts gaming category expectations.
C2. **Target audience:** Risk-averse, comfort-seeking users - potentially older adults or users with gambling concerns seeking "safe" aesthetics

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a comparative analysis perspective, this represents the lowest energy and confidence level across all options. The rounded letterforms and soft script create maximum approachability but minimum excitement. For gaming/entertainment, this appears to be the wrong optimization. Looking at the data on gaming user preferences, successful platforms balance energy, confidence, and clarity. This logo optimizes only for approachability, sacrificing the other key attributes. The functional concern is contrast: several background variations, particularly yellow, show poor contrast ratios with white text. Running contrast calculations, the yellow variant likely falls below WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text), creating accessibility and legibility issues. The script style adds legibility challenges at small sizes. Overall, this appears to be a strategic and categorical mismatch - it's well-executed for the wrong category.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - Highest memorability due to unique differentiator (tilted frame). In cognitive psychology, distinctiveness drives recall, and the angle creates the strongest unique visual signature.

**Logo 2** - High recall due to execution quality and sophistication. When something is notably well-designed, it creates stronger memory encoding.

**Logo 5** - Strong recall due to maximum visual weight. The heavy black outline creates such extreme contrast that it's difficult to forget, even if not preferred.

Analyzing the recall pattern: Logos 3 and 6 have lower differentiation from each other - both use script approaches with similar personality, causing them to compete for the same memory space, reducing individual recall. Logo 4 is similar to Logo 5 in boldness but lacks a unique differentiator (shadow vs. outline, with outline being more extreme), reducing its memorability. Logo 7 is memorable for negative reasons - the confusion it created rather than positive recognition.

From a data perspective, the logos with either the strongest unique features (1's angle, 5's outline) or highest execution quality (2's refinement) show highest recall. This aligns with memory research showing that both distinctiveness and quality drive retention.
