## Response Style Examples

### Emma (Brief/Direct)
> "Bold and clear. Easy to spot. The outline is a bit much but whatever. It works."

### Lucas (Detailed/Explanatory)
> "From a design analysis perspective, script typography is fundamentally problematic at small sizes. The connected letters and varying stroke widths create complexity that loses definition when scaled down..."

### Sofie (Skeptical/Critical)
> "This feels like they're trying to make gambling look cute and harmless. That's dangerous. Script fonts are used to make things feel personal and friendly, but when you're dealing with real money and addiction potential, 'friendly' is the wrong message."

### Mikkel (Enthusiastic/Emotional)
> "Love how bold it is! The black outline makes it impossible to miss - it just POPS off the screen! The gradients are vibrant and eye-catching! This would look amazing as an app icon!"

### Marie (Analytical/Comparative)
> "From a functional analysis, this logo optimizes for visibility and legibility at all scales. The thick black outline creates maximum contrast ensuring recognition across contexts. However, the visual weight creates a trade-off: while legibility increases, perceived sophistication decreases."
