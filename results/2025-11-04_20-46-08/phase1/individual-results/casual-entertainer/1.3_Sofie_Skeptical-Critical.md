# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Aggressive
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or betting app trying to look powerful
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - This feels like it's trying too hard to look confident. The shadow effect is a manipulation tactic to make it seem more substantial than it is. I'm skeptical of brands that need visual tricks to seem trustworthy.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow effect feels like a 2010s design trend that's past its prime
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - I can see why this fits gaming - it's bold and in-your-face, which matches the industry's typical aesthetic. But that's also the problem - it's exactly what I expect, which makes me suspicious it's following a formula.
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream users who respond to bold, aggressive marketing. Probably more male-skewing.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The shadow is unnecessary and feels manipulative - like they're adding visual weight to make the brand seem more important. We learned in marketing class that these design tricks are meant to influence perception without substance. The vibrant gradients with the shadow create this hyper-stimulating visual that's designed to grab attention, which makes me wonder if the actual platform is equally designed to be addictive rather than genuinely entertaining. I don't trust brands that need this much visual volume.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Corporate
A2. **What kind of company:** Tech startup trying to look professional
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - This feels more honest, actually. The minimalism suggests they're not trying to manipulate you with flashy effects. But I'm still cautious - sometimes minimalism is just another marketing strategy to seem sophisticated.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very current, follows all the minimal design trends
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market pretending to be premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This doesn't feel like gambling at all, which could be intentional. Maybe they're trying to make betting feel less like betting? That's actually a common tactic - make it look like just another entertainment app so people are less cautious.
C2. **Target audience:** Young professionals who want to feel like they're using a "respectable" platform, not a gambling site. It's designed to reduce the stigma.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I appreciate the clean design, but I'm suspicious of what it's hiding. The sophistication feels like a veneer to make gambling more palatable. In my marketing classes, we discuss how brands use minimal design to appear ethical and trustworthy even when the product itself might be problematic. That said, from a pure design perspective, it's well-executed. I just question the intent behind making a betting app look so refined and innocuous.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Pretentious
A2. **What kind of company:** Something trying too hard to look exclusive or sophisticated
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - This feels like they're hiding behind abstraction. When brands make their logos this unclear, I wonder what else they're being unclear about. Terms and conditions? Odds? Fees?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monograms are trendy, but this feels like they're using trendiness as a substitute for substance
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Pretending to be premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This doesn't communicate anything about gaming or entertainment. It's so abstract it could be literally anything, which feels dishonest. Be clear about what you are.
C2. **Target audience:** People who want to feel exclusive or special, which is exactly the psychology gambling platforms exploit. Make users feel like VIPs so they spend more.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I don't trust this at all. The abstraction feels like deliberate obfuscation. If you can't clearly communicate what your brand is, why should I trust you with my money? This looks like it's designed to appeal to people's desire for status and sophistication, which is a classic marketing manipulation. The connected letterforms are trying to seem elegant, but to me they just seem unclear. In marketing, we learn that clarity builds trust - this is the opposite of that.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gimmicky
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming app using novelty to stand out
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The tilt feels like a design gimmick. When brands rely on tricks like angled elements, it makes me think they don't have substance to offer, so they're using novelty instead.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The stamp aesthetic is trendy right now, but trends fade
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - The energy fits, but the gimmick bothers me. It feels like they're trying to be different just for the sake of being different.
C2. **Target audience:** Young users who are attracted to novelty and "fun" design without thinking critically about what's behind it.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I'm skeptical of the tilted frame. It's distinctive, sure, but distinction through gimmicks isn't the same as distinction through quality. The angle creates visual instability, which unconsciously signals unreliability - that's basic design psychology that makes me wonder if they understand what they're doing or if they just thought it looked cool. The bold contrast works for visibility, but the overall approach feels like form over function, which is a red flag for me. Brands that prioritize looking different over being trustworthy are concerning.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Loud
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile gaming app shouting for attention
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The heavy outline feels aggressive, like they're yelling at me to notice them. Brands that need to shout usually don't have much to say.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The high-contrast outlined style is current
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It fits because it's loud and attention-grabbing, which is typical for the industry. But that's exactly what makes me skeptical - it's following the playbook of overstimulation.
C2. **Target audience:** Casual users who respond to bold, simple visuals without questioning what's behind them.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick black outline is excessive. It's designed to make the logo impossible to ignore, which is a common manipulation tactic in the gambling industry - constant visibility leads to constant awareness leads to constant engagement. I see through it. The vibrant gradients with the heavy outline create maximum visual noise, which is intentional - they want your attention at all costs. From a critical perspective, this represents everything I'm wary of in gambling app design: loud, aggressive, hyperstimulating visuals designed to grab attention rather than earn trust.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Manipulative
A2. **What kind of company:** Social or lifestyle app trying to seem friendly and harmless
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - This feels like they're trying to make gambling look cute and harmless. That's dangerous. Script fonts are used to make things feel personal and friendly, but when you're dealing with real money and addiction potential, "friendly" is the wrong message.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts go in and out of trend. This feels like 2016-2018.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This is completely wrong for betting, and I suspect that's intentional. Make it look cute and casual so people don't think critically about the fact that they're gambling. It's a manipulation tactic to reduce perceived risk.
C2. **Target audience:** Young, naive users who might not recognize gambling for what it is. The friendly script is designed to lower defenses.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This feels dishonest. The playful script typography is completely inappropriate for a platform where people can lose real money. It's like putting cartoon characters on cigarette packages - it's designed to make something potentially harmful seem fun and harmless. In my marketing ethics class, we discussed how gambling companies use friendly, casual branding to reduce psychological barriers to engagement. This logo is a textbook example. The script doesn't work functionally either - it'll be illegible at small sizes - but the bigger issue is the ethical problem of making betting look like a children's game.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase "yes" script)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Deceptive
A2. **What kind of company:** Trying to look like a wellness or kids' app to disguise what it really is
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - This is even worse than Logo 3. The rounded, soft script is clearly designed to make gambling look innocent and safe. I don't trust any brand that uses design to misrepresent its true nature.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The rounded style is trendy in certain sectors, but it's wrong here
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This doesn't fit at all, and that's the point. They're deliberately choosing inappropriate aesthetics to make gambling seem less like gambling. That's manipulative.
C2. **Target audience:** People who would normally be cautious about gambling but might lower their guard if it looks harmless enough. That's predatory targeting.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Everything about this bothers me from an ethics perspective. The soft, bubbly letterforms are clearly designed to evoke feelings of safety and friendliness, which is the opposite of what you should feel about gambling. This is like those payday loan companies that use bright colors and friendly mascots to disguise predatory lending. The poor contrast on the yellow background is actually the least of the problems here - the bigger issue is the dishonest framing. Gambling companies have a responsibility to be clear about what they are, not to hide behind cute design. This logo represents everything I've learned to be skeptical about in marketing manipulation.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 7** - I remember this because it annoyed me with its pretentious abstraction. When something feels deliberately unclear, it sticks in your mind as a negative example.

**Logo 3** - This one stuck with me because the script felt so inappropriate and manipulative for a gambling platform. It stood out as an example of misleading design.

**Logo 5** - The aggressive outline was so loud it's hard to forget, even though I didn't like it. It was yelling for attention, which unfortunately works for memorability even if it doesn't work for trust.

I'm less clear on the differences between Logos 4 and 1 - both were bold and using visual tricks (shadow vs. angle) that felt gimmicky. Logo 2 was memorable for being the least offensive, which is noteworthy in itself. Logo 6 blurred with Logo 3 since they're both scripts that felt wrong for the category.

From a critical perspective, I notice that the logos I remember best are the ones that triggered the strongest skeptical reactions - either because they were manipulative (3, 6), aggressive (5), or pretentious (7). Logo 2 stands out for being relatively honest in its presentation, which is actually the most memorable quality in a category full of manipulation.
