# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase "yes" script friendly style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gentle, I think?
A2. **What kind of company:** Maybe something relaxing... wellness or meditation app? Not really sure
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - I guess it seems friendly but maybe too informal for spending money? I'm not certain
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - It's okay, nothing special I think
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget probably, or maybe mass-market? Hard to say

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - I don't think so? It feels too soft for gambling but I could be wrong
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who are nervous about gambling like me? Or possibly very casual users?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The rounded letters seem nice and non-threatening, which I appreciate I guess. But I'm a bit worried that it might look too casual for a real company. The white text on yellow is kind of hard to read - or is it just me? I'm not sure if that's a problem or if I'm being too critical. It might be fine for some people. I just feel uncertain about whether this would make me trust the app enough to actually use it.

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive "Yes" playful style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Playful maybe?
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be a social app? Or maybe something creative? I'm not really sure
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - It seems fun but I don't know if I'd trust it with money
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Might be trendy? Or maybe not. Hard to tell
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget I think, but I could be wrong

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Probably not the right fit? But I guess some people might like playful
C2. **Target audience:** Young people maybe? People who aren't worried about things like I am?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The colors are nice and bright, which might be good? But the script font makes me a little uncertain - I think it might be hard to read when it's small, but maybe that's not important. I'm worried it looks too casual for betting where you use real money. But then again, maybe casual is good? I'm not sure. It just doesn't make me feel very confident about using it, though I suppose other people might feel differently.

## LOGO 1 (Bold "YES" in tilted rectangular stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Energetic I guess
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming maybe? Or events?
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It seems confident but the tilted angle makes me a bit uncertain about stability?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Probably modern? The angle seems current maybe
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market I think

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - Could work for gaming I suppose? The energy might be right
C2. **Target audience:** People who are more confident than me probably. Younger casual players maybe?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted frame is distinctive, which I think is good for recognition? But I'm a bit worried that the angle might look messy on my phone screen with all my other apps. It has personality though, which could be positive. I'm just not certain if it's too much or if it's the right amount. It's bolder than I usually go for, but maybe that's what gaming apps should be? I don't know.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Loud
A2. **What kind of company:** Probably a game app? Mobile gaming I think
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It's straightforward I guess, but might be a bit aggressive?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Seems current maybe
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market or possibly budget? Not sure

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - I think it fits the category? Seems like gaming style
C2. **Target audience:** Casual gamers probably. People who want simple entertainment maybe.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick black outline makes it very visible, which I suppose is practical for finding the app on my phone. But I'm not certain if it's too much - it feels pretty bold and I usually prefer things more subtle. Though maybe for a gaming app bold is better? I really don't know. It's functional I guess, but I'm worried it might be too in-your-face. Or maybe that's fine. I'm just not sure what the right amount is.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram - abstract connected letterforms)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confused
A2. **What kind of company:** I don't know - could be anything?

A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The style seems modern maybe?
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying to be premium I think? But I'm not certain

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - I can't really tell if it fits because I don't know what it's saying
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who like abstract designs? I'm not the right person for this probably

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I think the connected letters are trying to be clever, but I'm having trouble reading it as "YES." Maybe I'm just not getting it? It could be sophisticated, or it could be too complicated - I honestly can't tell. I worry that if I can't figure it out easily, I might not feel comfortable using the app. But maybe other people would understand it better. I'm just really uncertain about what this is trying to communicate.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined, clean, modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Clean I think
A2. **What kind of company:** Tech company maybe? Could be streaming or social
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - It looks professional, which makes me feel more comfortable
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very modern I think
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market but looks more expensive maybe?

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It's well-designed but I'm not sure if it says "gaming" specifically
C2. **Target audience:** People who care about design probably. Maybe younger professionals?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This one feels the most professional and polished, which I appreciate because it makes me less worried about the company being unreliable. The clean design is nice. But I'm a bit concerned that the white text on some of those darker backgrounds might be hard to see? Maybe that's not a problem though. It looks like a company that knows what they're doing, which is important to me since I'm always nervous about gambling apps. I think I might feel more comfortable trying an app with this logo, but I'm still not 100% certain.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Strong maybe?
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or sports I think
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Seems confident but I'm not sure about the shadow
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Could be a bit dated? Not certain though
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market probably

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - I think it fits gaming? The bold style seems right
C2. **Target audience:** General gamers maybe? People who want straightforward experiences

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The bold text is easy to read, which I like because I don't want to struggle to find the app. The shadow adds some dimension I guess, though I'm not sure if it's necessary. It feels a bit heavy to me, but maybe that's appropriate for gaming? I don't know enough about design to say for certain. It seems competent and functional, which is reassuring, but I'm not particularly excited about it either. It's probably fine for most people.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

I think I remember **Logo 2** best because it looked the most professional and that stuck with me. It made me feel less anxious about the company.

Maybe **Logo 7** too, but mostly because I was confused by it and spent time trying to figure out what it said.

**Logo 1** might be memorable because of the tilted angle? But I'm not certain.

The others kind of blur together in my mind - there were several bold ones and a couple of script ones, but I'm having trouble distinguishing them clearly now. I guess **Logo 6** was the gentlest one? And **Logo 3** was playful? But I could be mixing them up.

I'm not very confident in my memory honestly. I feel like I should remember them better but they sort of run together except for the really clean professional one and the confusing abstract one.
