# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive "Yes" playful style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Nostalgic
A2. **What kind of company:** Reminds me of those handwritten invitation cards my grandmother used to send. Maybe a creative app or something artistic?
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It's got personality, but it reminds me of this time when I downloaded what I thought was a professional editing app and it turned out to be pretty amateur. The script feels personal but maybe too casual for betting.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - It's like those coffee shops that try to look vintage but opened last year, you know?
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, definitely reminds me of student-made posters

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - So there was this time I went to a casino in Copenhagen with some friends for a birthday. Everything was sleek and professional-looking. This feels more like a kids' party invitation than that experience.
C2. **Target audience:** Probably young people who want something that doesn't take itself too seriously. Like my friends who play games just for fun, not the ones who actually track their wins.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The colorful backgrounds remind me of these photos I took at a music festival last summer - vibrant and fun. But when I'm thinking about using an app where I'm spending real money, I want something that feels more substantial. It's like when I was choosing which platform to sell my photos on - I went with the one that looked professional, not the one with the cute logo.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase "yes" script friendly style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Friendly
A2. **What kind of company:** This reminds me of a meditation app I tried once, or maybe a wellness thing
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - It's too soft. Like when I was looking for insurance for my camera equipment - I didn't want something that looked like a children's toy, I needed something serious.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Feels safe but nothing special, you know?
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, feels like free apps I've downloaded

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - I remember walking past a betting shop in Aalborg once, and everything about it screamed confidence and energy. This is the opposite - it's like a lullaby when you need rock music.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who are really nervous about gambling? Or kids, but they shouldn't be gambling anyway.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The rounded letters are easy to read, which is nice. But there's this story - I was hired to shoot photos for a tech startup once, and they specifically told me they wanted to move away from looking "too friendly" because customers weren't taking them seriously. This logo has that same problem. The white on yellow is really hard to read too, reminds me of trying to photograph in harsh midday sun - the contrast just doesn't work.

## LOGO 1 (Bold "YES" in tilted rectangular stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or maybe event tickets - it's got that "let's go!" energy
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - This one feels more confident. It reminds me of the stamp I use on my photography work - bold and clear.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The tilted angle is current, like those Instagram stickers people use
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, accessible but with personality

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - There's this bar in Aalborg where they have poker nights, and their promotional materials have this same kind of energetic, angled vibe. It works because it feels exciting without being overwhelming.
C2. **Target audience:** People like me - not super serious gamblers, but we want something that feels alive and fun. Casual players who want personality.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted frame tells a story on its own - it's like "yes, let's do this!" which is exactly the feeling you want when you're deciding to play a game. I shot a series of photos once with all the frames intentionally tilted to create energy, and it worked the same way. But I'm thinking about how this would look on my phone screen - the angle means it won't sit neatly with my other apps, which might be annoying. Still, it's memorable.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram - abstract connected letterforms)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confused
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything - fashion, finance, fitness? I honestly can't tell
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - When something is too abstract, I don't trust it. It's like those art galleries that won't tell you what the art is about - you're left guessing.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The monogram style is trendy, I'll give it that
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying to be premium but not quite getting there

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - So I was doing photography for a gaming convention once, and none of the gaming companies had logos like this. They all had clear, readable branding because they wanted instant recognition. This doesn't give me that.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who want to feel sophisticated? But I think they'd be frustrated trying to figure out what it actually says.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The connected letterforms are clever from a design perspective - it's like when I create a series of photos that flow into each other. But this is where the photographer in me sees the problem: your main subject should be clear. With this logo, I'm squinting trying to read "YES" in the "YS," and that cognitive effort takes away from the experience. When I'm scrolling through my phone looking for the app, I need immediate recognition, not a puzzle.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Loud
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile game, probably something casual but energetic
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It's assertive, which can be good, but it's also a bit much. Like that friend who talks too loud in quiet cafes.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The heavy outline is trendy right now, very app-store aesthetic
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, maybe even leaning budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - I was at a café in Copenhagen once and saw someone playing a slots app with this kind of bold, colorful design. It fits the category, but it doesn't stand out as special.
C2. **Target audience:** Young casual players who want something simple and straightforward. Not people looking for a premium experience.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick black outline is like when I add a border to photos to make them pop on social media - it definitely increases visibility. And I appreciate that because on a small phone screen, you need that contrast. But there's a balance between "pops" and "screams," and this feels closer to screaming. The gradient backgrounds are fine but nothing I haven't seen before. It's functional but not memorable. It's like stock photography - it works, but you won't remember it tomorrow.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Bold
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming, sports, something with confidence
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The shadow gives it presence, but it also feels a little dated. Reminds me of designs from when I was a teenager.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Shadow effects were everywhere five years ago, now they feel a bit retro
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - It's got the right energy for gaming. There was this esports tournament I photographed last year, and a lot of the branding had this bold, shadowed look. It works for the category.
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream gamers, probably people who like straightforward experiences without overthinking it.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** As a photographer, I understand the shadow effect - it's trying to create depth and dimension, like how I use shadows to add drama to a portrait. But in logo design, especially at small sizes, that shadow might just muddy the clarity. The bold text is very readable though, which matters when you're trying to find the app quickly. It's competent but not exciting. It's like the difference between a well-exposed photo and a photo that tells a story - this one is well-exposed.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined, clean, modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Sleek
A2. **What kind of company:** Tech company, maybe a streaming service or social platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - This feels professional and polished, like a company that knows what it's doing
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very current, minimal and clean
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with premium aspirations

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It's well-designed, but it doesn't immediately say "gaming" to me. I was editing photos for a fintech app recently, and this could easily fit that world too.
C2. **Target audience:** Design-conscious people who care about aesthetics. Younger millennials and Gen Z who want their apps to look good on their home screen.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is the photographer's choice from a pure aesthetics perspective - the typography is refined, the gradients are sophisticated. I'd be proud to have this on my phone from a design standpoint. But here's the story: I once worked with a client who wanted minimalist branding, and we had to find the balance between "refined" and "invisible." This logo might be too refined - at small app icon size, that subtle white text on those darker gradient backgrounds might blend in too much. It's beautiful in isolation, but on a crowded phone screen with dozens of colorful app icons competing for attention, it might disappear. That's the tradeoff between elegant and effective.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted stamp/sticker style. It tells a story with that angle - immediate energy and movement. As a photographer, I'm drawn to anything that creates visual interest through unconventional framing.

**Logo 2** - The refined lowercase version stuck with me because of how clean it is. It's like a perfectly composed minimal photo - everything unnecessary has been stripped away.

**Logo 7** - I remember this because I spent time trying to decode it, which isn't necessarily good. It's like those abstract photos that make you work to understand them - memorable, but frustrating.

The others blur together a bit - they're all bold text with gradients, and while each has slight differences, they don't have distinctive stories that make them stick in my mind. It's like looking through a series of similar photos - individual details fade, but the ones with unique angles or perspectives stay with you.
