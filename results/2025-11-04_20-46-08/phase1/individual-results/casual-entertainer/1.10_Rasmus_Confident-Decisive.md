# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Direct
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile gaming app
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Functional but nothing impressive
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Current app-store aesthetic
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, middle of the road

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Fits the category appropriately
C2. **Target audience:** Casual gamers who want simplicity without frills

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick black outline ensures visibility - that's smart. High contrast, easy to read, functional. But it's pedestrian. There's no sophistication here, no elevation. It's the logo equivalent of getting the job done without exceeding expectations. For a premium user like myself, I want more refinement. This is adequate but uninspiring. It won't hurt the brand, but it won't help it stand out either.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined, clean, modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Sophisticated
A2. **What kind of company:** Premium tech platform
A3. **Trust level:** 5/5 - Professional execution signals competent organization
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Absolutely current, on-trend
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Premium aspiration, mass-market accessibility

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - High-quality design works for entertainment, though not category-specific
C2. **Target audience:** Design-conscious professionals who demand quality

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is the clear winner from a design perspective. Clean typography, sophisticated gradients, modern aesthetic. It signals that the company invests in quality and cares about user experience. That matters to me - I'm not interested in budget apps with amateur branding. This looks professional. The only concern is category differentiation - it could be any entertainment platform. But the execution quality is undeniable. This is what premium users expect.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram - abstract connected letterforms)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Pretentious
A2. **What kind of company:** Unclear - trying too hard to be clever
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Abstraction without clarity reduces credibility
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monogram approach is contemporary
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Aspiring to premium, achieving confusion

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Fails to communicate category
C2. **Target audience:** Unclear - potentially alienates more people than it attracts

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is design for design's sake. The connected letterforms are clever in theory but fail in execution. If I have to work to decode "YES" from "YS," that's poor communication. In sales, we talk about removing friction from the customer journey - this adds friction. It's trying to be sophisticated but comes across as obscure. Premium doesn't mean confusing; it means elevated clarity. This misses the mark completely. Not what I'd choose for my business or entertainment.

## LOGO 1 (Bold "YES" in tilted rectangular stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Energetic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or events platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - Confident personality, clear communication
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Tilted stamp aesthetic is current
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with personality

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - Perfect energy level for the category
C2. **Target audience:** Confident casual players who want entertainment with edge

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This has personality and differentiation - two critical factors. The tilted frame creates immediate visual distinction. It's bold without being aggressive, energetic without being chaotic. In a crowded market, you need something memorable, and this delivers. The only consideration is the unconventional footprint on a phone screen, but I'd argue the memorability outweighs that concern. This is a strong contender - it balances approachability with impact.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Solid
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or sports betting
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Competent but dated execution
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Shadow effects feel 2015-2018
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Appropriate energy for category
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream gamers, not design-focused users

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The shadow effect is a dated design trend. Five years ago, this would have been current. Now it feels behind the curve. The bold typography is functional and the contrast is good, but the shadow adds unnecessary visual weight without adding value. In business, we eliminate what doesn't serve a purpose - that shadow should go. The core is solid, but the execution needs modernization. Not what I'd recommend for a forward-thinking brand.

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive "Yes" playful style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Juvenile
A2. **What kind of company:** Lifestyle brand, definitely not betting
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too casual for financial transactions
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script can go either way
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, possibly hobbyist

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Completely wrong tone for the category
C2. **Target audience:** Very young, very casual users - not my demographic

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is a mismatch between form and function. Script typography says "friendly and informal" while betting says "confident and capable." Those messages conflict. The vibrant backgrounds are fine, but they can't save the fundamental misalignment. In sales, I'd call this a positioning failure - it's targeting the wrong audience with the wrong message. Additionally, script faces readability challenges at small sizes. This wouldn't make my shortlist.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase "yes" script friendly style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Weak
A2. **What kind of company:** Children's app or meditation platform
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - Far too informal for betting
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Safe but unremarkable
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Wrong category entirely
C2. **Target audience:** Risk-averse users, possibly too risk-averse for gambling

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This completely misreads the category and audience. Betting requires confidence - this projects timidity. The rounded script is too gentle, too passive. When I'm choosing entertainment that involves money, I want the platform to project competence and strength, not softness. The white-on-yellow has poor contrast - basic design failure. This wouldn't pass a first-round review in any professional setting. Definitely not suitable.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 2** - Clear winner. Professional, sophisticated, modern. The refined execution stands out.

**Logo 1** - Strong second. The tilted frame creates distinctive visual memory. Energetic and memorable.

**Logo 7** - Memorable for negative reasons. The confusion it created makes it stick, but not in a positive way.

The rest blur together because they lack distinguishing characteristics:
- Logo 5 is functional but forgettable
- Logo 4 is competent but dated
- Logo 3 and 6 are both scripts that miss the category mark

From a decision-making perspective, I remember the ones that either excel (2, 1) or fail notably (7). The middle ground doesn't create strong memory - it's noise.

My ranking would be:
1. **Logo 2** - Premium execution
2. **Logo 1** - Distinctive personality
3. **Logo 5** - Functional baseline

The others don't merit consideration for a professional gaming platform.
