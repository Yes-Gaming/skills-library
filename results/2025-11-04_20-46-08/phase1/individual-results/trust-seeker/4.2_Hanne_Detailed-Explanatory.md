# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

Thank you for including me in this evaluation. As someone who has extensively researched Spillemyndigheden-licensed sites and maintains detailed transaction records of all my gambling activities, I appreciate the opportunity to provide thorough feedback. I approach this systematically, as I do with all financial decisions.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase script, friendly style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Informal
- A2. What kind of company: The rounded, handwritten appearance suggests a casual gaming application, possibly targeting a younger demographic or those seeking a more relaxed entertainment experience
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - The reason I rate this lower on trust is because the informal script style doesn't convey the professionalism I expect from a licensed gambling operator. When I researched platforms, those with proper Spillemyndigheden licensing consistently presented more formal branding
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5 - It has a contemporary casual aesthetic, but this style has been common for several years now
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Budget to mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - My concern here is that iGaming platforms handle real money transactions and must demonstrate regulatory compliance. The casual script doesn't communicate the seriousness required
- C2. Target audience: This would appeal to very casual players who prioritize fun over security, likely younger demographics (25-35) who may not have had negative experiences with unlicensed operators

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Let me explain my reasoning thoroughly. The friendly aesthetic is approachable, which has value for reducing intimidation factor. However, from my extensive research into licensed operators, I've observed that trustworthy platforms balance approachability with professional credibility. This logo leans too heavily toward casual, which raises concerns about whether the company takes responsible gambling seriously. When I reviewed Spillemyndigheden's requirements, legitimate operators must display licensing information, responsible gambling tools, and clear terms - this branding doesn't suggest that institutional maturity. The handwritten style also creates legibility concerns across different screen sizes, which I tested when comparing mobile platforms.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Established
- A2. What kind of company: This suggests a more traditional gaming or betting platform, possibly one with years of operation. The shadow effect adds dimensionality that conveys substance
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - This rates significantly higher because the bold, three-dimensional presentation communicates stability. When I analyzed platform designs during my research phase, established licensed operators often used dimensional typography to convey permanence
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5 - The shadow effect is somewhat traditional, reminiscent of 2010s digital design, but that's not necessarily negative for trust signaling
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market leaning toward premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - This is appropriate for the industry. The reason it fits well is that it communicates both entertainment value and operational credibility
- C2. Target audience: Adults 35-55, experienced gamblers who value established brands, people like myself who want proven reliability

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: The dimensional shadow effect works effectively because it creates visual weight and substance - important qualities when you're asking customers to trust you with financial transactions. The bold typography ensures clarity, which is essential for licensing display requirements. What works particularly well is that this could accommodate the mandatory Spillemyndigheden logo alongside it without visual conflict. My one consideration is that while it communicates stability, it might benefit from slightly more modern refinement in the shadow execution to balance tradition with contemporary expectations. When I compared licensed platforms, those successfully balancing both elements retained customers longer. The color variations shown work well - they provide variety without compromising the core trust signal.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined, clean, modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Professional
- A2. What kind of company: This immediately suggests a modern, well-established technology company with proper institutional backing and likely significant operational infrastructure
- A3. Trust level: **5/5** - This receives my highest trust rating, and I'll explain why in detail. The clean, refined typography demonstrates design maturity that correlates with operational maturity. When I conducted my platform research, I created a matrix comparing visual professionalism against actual licensing status, and there was a strong correlation between this type of refined branding and legitimate Spillemyndigheden licensing
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5 - This represents current best practices in digital platform branding
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 5/5 - Perfect fit for the industry because it balances accessibility with authority
- C2. Target audience: Adults 35-65, established professionals with disposable income, people who prioritize security and transparency, customers who research thoroughly before committing

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Let me break down why this succeeds on multiple levels. First, the typography: the lowercase presentation reduces aggression while the refined letterforms maintain authority - this is the exact balance needed for responsible gambling platforms. Second, the clean execution: no unnecessary embellishments means no distractions from essential information like licensing details and responsible gambling tools. When I evaluated platforms, those with cleaner interfaces consistently provided better access to terms and conditions. Third, the modern gradient backgrounds shown work exceptionally well because they add visual interest without compromising legibility or professional presentation. From an accountant's perspective, this suggests a company that invests in quality and pays attention to details - both indicators of proper operational standards. The spacing and proportions indicate professional design resources, which correlates with proper legal and compliance resources. If I saw this logo on a platform, I would feel confident proceeding to verify their Spillemyndigheden license number, whereas some other options would make me hesitate before even checking. This is the logo I would recommend to my sister or colleagues.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram - abstract connected letterforms)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Ambiguous
- A2. What kind of company: The abstract monogram style suggests either a design-forward tech startup or a company attempting to appear more sophisticated than it might be
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - I'm rating this lower, and here's my detailed reasoning: abstract logos prioritize aesthetic over communication, which is problematic for gambling platforms where clarity is essential. During my research, I noticed that newer, less-established operators sometimes used abstract branding to appear more sophisticated while lacking proper licensing
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5 - Very contemporary design language
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Attempting premium positioning

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Not appropriate for the industry's trust requirements
- C2. Target audience: Design-conscious younger adults (25-35) who prioritize aesthetics over established credibility, possibly inexperienced gamblers

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: I need to explain why, despite its sophisticated appearance, this doesn't work for a gambling platform. The fundamental issue is legibility - I had to study this to understand it says "YS." When customers are evaluating whether to trust a platform with their money, they shouldn't need to decode the logo. From my research comparing licensed versus unlicensed operators, abstract logos appeared more frequently among questionable operators, possibly because abstraction can obscure identity. This isn't to say this logo indicates anything negative about the actual company, but rather that it doesn't effectively communicate the transparency and clarity that should characterize a responsible gambling operator. Additionally, when I considered how this would appear alongside mandatory responsible gambling messaging and licensing information, the abstract style creates visual tension rather than harmony. For a gambling platform, every design element should reinforce rather than complicate trust signals. The monogram style might work excellently for a fashion brand or creative agency, but gambling requires different communication priorities.

## LOGO 1 (Bold "YES" in tilted rectangular stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Aggressive
- A2. What kind of company: This suggests a promotional, marketing-heavy company possibly prioritizing customer acquisition over customer care
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - The trust concern here stems from the aggressive, tilted presentation. Let me explain this rating thoroughly. When I researched gambling platforms, I specifically looked for what responsible gambling advocates warn against: overly stimulating design that might encourage impulsive behavior. The energetic, tilted stamp style with multiple competing elements creates exactly that concern
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5 - Contemporary but reminiscent of promotional sticker designs
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market to budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Doesn't align with responsible gambling principles
- C2. Target audience: Younger, more impulsive customers who respond to high-energy marketing, possibly inexperienced gamblers

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: I need to provide detailed reasoning for why this concerns me. The tilted angle creates dynamic energy, which in marketing terms increases attention - but for gambling platforms, we should question whether maximum attention-grabbing is appropriate. When I reviewed Spillemyndigheden's responsible gambling guidelines, they emphasize avoiding marketing that encourages excessive play. This design's energy level raises questions about company priorities. Additionally, the stamp/sticker style with bold rectangular frames creates visual noise that would compete with essential information like deposit limits, self-exclusion tools, and licensing details. From an operational perspective, this suggests a company investing heavily in acquisition rather than retention and customer care. The multiple color variations shown are jarring rather than cohesive - each feels like a separate promotion rather than consistent brand identity. When I maintain my gambling transaction records, I prefer platforms with clear, stable branding that doesn't create anxiety or urgency. This logo would concern me during my verification process before depositing funds.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Clear
- A2. What kind of company: A straightforward gaming platform that prioritizes clarity and directness, likely with transparent operations
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - This rates high, and I'll explain the reasoning behind this assessment. The thick outline creates strong definition and visibility, which translates to transparency - a crucial trust factor. When I researched platforms, those with clear, well-defined branding tended to have clearer terms and conditions
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5 - Contemporary with timeless elements
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Strong fit due to clarity and directness
- C2. Target audience: Broad demographic appeal, particularly adults 35-60 who value straightforward communication

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Let me analyze this systematically. The thick black outline serves multiple functions: it ensures legibility across all devices and backgrounds, creates strong brand recognition, and communicates solidity and reliability. From my accounting perspective, this suggests a company that values clear communication - essential for financial transactions. The bold "Yes" with capital Y followed by lowercase "es" provides a nice balance between assertion and approachability. When I evaluated platforms, those with this type of clear typography typically had better-organized account sections and more accessible responsible gambling tools. The color variations work well because the strong outline maintains consistency across different contexts. What works particularly effectively is that this logo would integrate smoothly with regulatory requirements - the Spillemyndigheden logo and age restriction warnings would complement rather than compete with this design. My only consideration is that while it's very clear and trustworthy, it's slightly less refined than Logo 2. However, for certain customer segments who prefer straightforward directness over sophisticated minimalism, this might actually be preferable. Both communicate trust, just through different aesthetic approaches. If Logo 2 says "premium professional," Logo 5 says "honest and direct" - both valuable trust signals, just targeting slightly different values.

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive "Yes" playful style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Playful
- A2. What kind of company: A casual, entertainment-focused gaming application prioritizing fun over seriousness
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - Middle rating, which I'll explain in detail. The script style is more approachable than some options, which has value, but it doesn't convey the institutional credibility I prioritize when evaluating gambling platforms
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5 - Current casual aesthetic
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 3/5 - Moderate fit with considerations
- C2. Target audience: Casual players 30-50 who prioritize entertainment value, possibly those new to online gambling seeking less intimidating entry point

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Let me provide a balanced analysis of this option. What works: the script style reduces the intimidation factor that some people feel around gambling platforms. When I discussed online gambling with friends who were hesitant to try it, their concerns often centered on feeling intimidated by the industry. This approachable style could help overcome that barrier. The playful nature also honestly communicates that this is entertainment, which aligns with responsible gambling messaging that frames gambling as entertainment rather than income opportunity. What concerns me: the script style, while friendly, doesn't convey the operational seriousness required for financial transactions. When I researched platforms, I looked for signals of proper customer service infrastructure, data security, and regulatory compliance - script typography doesn't typically signal those qualities. Additionally, script fonts can present legibility challenges, particularly for older users or those with visual impairments - an accessibility consideration that matters for responsible operations. The colorful backgrounds shown work reasonably well, though they increase the casual feel rather than balancing it. My assessment is that this would work better for a free-to-play social casino than a real-money gambling platform. For the latter, I prefer branding that acknowledges the seriousness of financial transactions while remaining approachable - a difficult balance, but essential for building trust with customers like myself who maintain detailed gambling budgets and expect professional operations.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:** Logo 2 and Logo 1

I'll explain the reasoning behind each. Logo 2 stands out in memory because it represents what I actively seek when researching gambling platforms - clean professionalism that suggests operational maturity and regulatory compliance. When I reviewed platforms during my research phase, I created detailed comparison spreadsheets, and those with this type of refined branding consistently scored higher across trust metrics. It's memorable because it represents the ideal.

Logo 1 is memorable for different reasons - it represents what I actively avoid. The aggressive, tilted style with competing color blocks created an immediate negative reaction that stays with me. When conducting research, I learned to recognize red flags, and overly aggressive marketing aesthetics became one of them after reading responsible gambling literature. It's memorable as a cautionary example.

The contrast between these two - one representing trust, one representing concern - makes both stand out clearly in memory. When I make financial decisions, both positive and negative indicators stay with me to inform future choices.

**Summary and Recommendation:**

After systematic evaluation of all seven logos, my rankings from a trust perspective are:

**Tier 1 - High Trust:**
- Logo 2 (5/5): Ideal combination of professionalism and accessibility
- Logo 5 (4/5): Clear, direct, honest presentation
- Logo 4 (4/5): Established feel with dimensional substance

**Tier 2 - Moderate Trust:**
- Logo 3 (3/5): Approachable but lacks professional credibility

**Tier 3 - Trust Concerns:**
- Logo 6 (2/5): Too informal for financial transactions
- Logo 7 (2/5): Abstract style obscures clarity
- Logo 1 (2/5): Aggressive marketing aesthetic raises concerns

For a platform targeting customers like myself - experienced adults who research thoroughly, value transparency, and expect professional operations - Logo 2 is clearly optimal. It would give me confidence to proceed with verification of Spillemyndigheden licensing and account setup. Logo 5 would be my second choice, offering similar trust signals through a different aesthetic approach.

The reason trust matters so profoundly in logo selection is that it's the first signal potential customers receive about company values and operational standards. Before I can verify licensing, read terms and conditions, or evaluate responsible gambling tools, I see the logo. If it doesn't inspire confidence to take those next investigative steps, the platform has lost the customer. This is why I've provided such detailed explanations - the logo isn't just aesthetic; it's a crucial trust signal that determines whether customers like myself engage with the platform at all.
