# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

Thank you for including me! My sister and I play together sometimes, and we're always discussing which platforms have good reputations. Word-of-mouth and recommendations matter so much to me - if people I trust recommend something, that says a lot. Let me share my thoughts from that perspective.

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive playful)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Friendly
- A2. What kind of company: Approachable, people-focused gaming company
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - This feels like something people would recommend to friends
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market, accessible

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Good fit for social recommendation
- C2. Target audience: People who rely on friend recommendations

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: My sister would like this! The friendly script style feels like the kind of brand you'd tell your friends about - "oh, I found this nice site, you should try it." It's approachable and warm, which makes it easier to recommend socially. When platforms have this kind of friendly branding, people feel comfortable saying "I use this" without seeming too serious about gambling. The colorful backgrounds work well for social sharing too - they're cheerful and positive. What makes this trustworthy from a word-of-mouth perspective is that it doesn't look intimidating or overly serious. My colleague Mette always says she prefers platforms that don't make gambling feel like a heavy, serious thing - this captures that well. It's the kind of logo that would look fine if someone took a screenshot of a win to share with friends. The reputation this could build would be around being friendly and accessible, which spreads well through recommendations. My only small concern is whether it looks professional enough for everyone's taste, but among my friend group, I think people would speak positively about this.

## LOGO 5 (Bold with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Trustworthy
- A2. What kind of company: Reliable, well-recommended platform
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - The kind of brand I could easily recommend
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market, broad appeal

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 5/5 - Perfect for word-of-mouth trust
- C2. Target audience: People who value peer recommendations and reputation

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is the kind of brand I could easily recommend to colleagues or family without hesitation. The clear, bold presentation says "we're legitimate and trustworthy" - exactly what you want when recommending something to people you care about. When my sister asked me to help her find a gambling site, I looked for ones with good online reviews and clear branding like this. The thick outline and straightforward design suggest this would have positive reputation - people trust clear, honest branding. My colleague always says "I only play on sites my friends use" and this looks like the kind of brand that would get positive word-of-mouth. It's not trying to be fancy or manipulative, just honest and direct. That builds good reputation. The color variations are cheerful without being overwhelming - they'd look good in any conversation or recommendation. What I particularly like from an HR perspective is that this looks like a company that would treat employees well, which usually means they treat customers well too - that creates positive reviews and recommendations. If my sister asked "do you think this looks trustworthy?", I'd say yes. If colleagues asked "have you heard good things about this?", even if I hadn't used it, the branding suggests it would have positive reputation. That's valuable for word-of-mouth growth.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase clean modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Professional
- A2. What kind of company: Well-established, highly recommended platform
- A3. Trust level: **5/5** - People definitely recommend this to each other
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Premium, quality

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 5/5 - Perfect reputation builder
- C2. Target audience: People who research recommendations and reviews

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Everyone I know would speak positively about this! The professional, clean design is exactly what creates strong word-of-mouth reputation. When my sister and I discuss gambling sites, we always mention the ones that look legitimate and professional - this is that. People trust recommendations more when the brand looks like this - sophisticated, established, credible. My colleagues would definitely feel comfortable recommending this to each other. "Have you tried Yes Games? It looks really professional and trustworthy" - that's the conversation this would generate. The clean typography and subtle gradients suggest a company that invests in quality, which means positive customer experiences, which means good reviews and recommendations. From an HR perspective, I notice when companies present themselves professionally like this - it usually indicates good internal culture, which flows through to customer service, which creates positive reputation. This is the kind of brand that gets recommended in professional circles, family circles, friend circles - universal appeal through trustworthiness. My sister's friends all use well-branded platforms like this, and they share recommendations actively. The reputation this could build would be excellent because it appeals to people's desire to recommend quality, trustworthy services. No one wants to recommend something that might cause problems for their friends - this looks completely safe to recommend.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram abstract)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Sophisticated
- A2. What kind of company: Design-forward, possibly well-regarded in certain circles
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - Mixed word-of-mouth potential
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Premium, selective

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 3/5 - Limited recommendation appeal
- C2. Target audience: Design-conscious people, limited broader appeal

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is interesting from a word-of-mouth perspective. Among certain groups - like my design-conscious colleagues - this might get positive buzz. They'd appreciate the sophisticated, modern aesthetic and might recommend it to each other saying "oh, there's this really well-designed platform." But among broader circles - like my family or older colleagues - this might create confused word-of-mouth. "I tried this site, but I can't even remember the name" or "It has this abstract logo, kind of hard to find again." For reputation building, clear recognition is essential. When my sister and her friends recommend things to each other, they need to be able to describe it easily. This would be hard to describe. "You know, the one with the abstract Y and S connected?" - that's not as effective as "the one with the bold Yes." The sophistication might create premium reputation in certain circles, but it might also create uncertainty in others. Mixed word-of-mouth potential. Some people would think it's too unclear to recommend confidently.

## LOGO 4 (Bold YES with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Established
- A2. What kind of company: Traditional, well-known operator with good reputation
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - Strong word-of-mouth potential
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market to premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Good reputation builder
- C2. Target audience: People who value established brands with proven reputation

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: My sister's older friends would really trust this! The dimensional, established look suggests a brand that's been recommended for years - "oh yes, everyone uses Yes Games, it's been around forever." Even if it's new, it looks established, which creates word-of-mouth credibility. People trust recommendations more when the brand looks proven and substantial. My colleagues in their 50s always talk about using platforms that "feel reliable" - this has that quality. The shadow effect adds visual weight that suggests substance and reputation. When people recommend gambling sites to each other, they want to recommend ones that won't cause problems - this looks like it has a track record of reliability. The reputation this would build would be around being solid, trustworthy, and proven. Not the most exciting word-of-mouth ("it's fine, reliable"), but very safe recommendation territory. My sister would feel comfortable recommending this to our parents' generation especially. The traditional feel might generate less buzz among younger groups, but it would generate very positive reputation among the demographic that matters most for trust - 40+. That's valuable word-of-mouth within the right circles.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase script friendly)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Casual
- A2. What kind of company: Friendly, socially-oriented platform
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - Mixed - casual enough to share, but professional enough to trust?
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Budget, accessible

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 3/5 - Uncertain word-of-mouth quality
- C2. Target audience: Very casual social groups

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is tricky from a word-of-mouth perspective. The friendly, casual style makes it very shareable socially - "oh look at this cute gambling site I found!" But that casualness might also create reputation concerns. Would my colleagues feel comfortable recommending something this casual with real money involved? I'm not sure. My sister might say "it's cute but is it legitimate?" The handwritten style is approachable for social sharing, but it might generate word-of-mouth questions about professionalism. "Have you heard if this is actually licensed?" When brands look too casual, even if they are legitimate, the reputation can suffer because people are unsure what to tell others. It's the kind of thing that might spread through very casual social circles ("my friend's friend uses it"), but wouldn't get recommended in professional contexts. The yellow-green is cheerful for social sharing, but doesn't inspire confidence for recommendations that stake your reputation. When I recommend something to colleagues or family, I want to be sure it won't reflect badly on me - this creates uncertainty. Could generate casual buzz, but not strong trust-based recommendations.

## LOGO 1 (Bold tilted stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Energetic
- A2. What kind of company: Marketing-focused, trying to go viral
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - Concerning word-of-mouth signals
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Budget, attention-seeking

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Poor reputation builder
- C2. Target audience: Impulsive people, not trusted recommenders

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This concerns me from a word-of-mouth perspective. The aggressive, tilted design might create initial buzz ("have you seen this loud new gambling site?"), but would it create positive reputation? I don't think so. People I know would be skeptical to recommend this. "It looks kind of sketchy" or "It's trying too hard" - that's the word-of-mouth this might generate. My sister would probably say "I don't know about this one, it looks like those sites with problems." When platforms have chaotic, pushy branding, even if they're legitimate, the reputation suffers because people associate that aesthetic with sketchy operations. My colleagues would not recommend this to each other - it doesn't inspire recommendation confidence. The tilted chaos suggests the platform prioritizes marketing over customer care, which creates negative word-of-mouth when people have issues. "Oh yeah, they spend all their money on advertising but customer service is terrible" - that's the reputation risk here. In HR, we talk about employer branding and reputation - this kind of aggressive approach rarely builds positive long-term reputation. It might get attention, but not trust-based recommendations. Would not feel comfortable recommending this to people I care about.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:** Logo 2 and Logo 5

Logo 2 because it's the one everyone would talk positively about - "that really professional, trustworthy one." Strong positive word-of-mouth sticks in memory.

Logo 5 because it's the one I'd confidently recommend to family and colleagues - "that clear, honest one." Recommendation-worthy brands are memorable because you think "I should tell others about this."

Both are memorable through their word-of-mouth potential - they're brands I'd actively discuss with others.

**My Word-of-Mouth Rankings:**

Based on reputation and recommendation potential:

**Would Confidently Recommend (strong positive word-of-mouth):**
- Logo 2 (5/5): Everyone would speak positively about this
- Logo 5 (4/5): Easy to recommend to anyone
- Logo 4 (4/5): Solid reputation among right demographics
- Logo 3 (4/5): Friendly, shareable, positive buzz

**Uncertain Recommendation (mixed word-of-mouth):**
- Logo 7 (3/5): Good in design circles, confusing in broader circles
- Logo 6 (3/5): Casual enough to share, but trust concerns

**Would Not Recommend (poor reputation signals):**
- Logo 1 (2/5): Looks sketchy, wouldn't risk my reputation recommending it

For me, gambling site choice is heavily influenced by what my sister and colleagues say. The platforms with the best reputations are ones people feel confident recommending - that's Logos 2, 5, and 4. Those would generate the positive word-of-mouth that builds lasting trust.

When my sister asks "is this any good?", I want to be able to say "yes, definitely" without hesitation. That's what builds strong reputation in communities, and reputation is everything when it comes to trust.
