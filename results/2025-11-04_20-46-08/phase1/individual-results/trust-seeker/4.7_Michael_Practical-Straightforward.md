# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

Alright. I'm a straightforward guy - I install electrical systems, they work or they don't. No fancy talk. Same goes for gambling sites. I want clear, honest, no surprises. Here's what I think.

---

## LOGO 5 (Bold with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Clear
- A2. What kind of company: Straightforward gambling platform
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - Clear and honest presentation
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market, accessible

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Good honest fit
- C2. Target audience: Regular working people who want straightforward service

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is good. Bold, clear, you know exactly what you're looking at. The thick outline means it's visible and easy to read - no tricks. When I work with electrical plans, the best ones are clear and simple. Same principle here. You can read it, you understand it immediately, no hidden complexity. The colors work fine - they don't interfere with the main message. What I like is that this doesn't try to be fancy or manipulate you. It just says "Yes" clearly. That's honest. When I'm depositing money for my weekend betting, I want to see exactly where it's going - clear branding like this suggests clear operations. No hidden fees, no complicated terms buried in small print. Just straightforward service. Only reason it's not perfect 5/5 is it's a bit generic - but honestly, for transparency, generic and clear is better than fancy and confusing.

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive playful)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Fancy
- A2. What kind of company: Trying to be artistic
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - Too fancy, not straightforward enough
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Wrong approach
- C2. Target audience: People who care about style over function

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Why use a complicated, fancy font? When you're dealing with money, keep it simple. This script style is trying to look artistic or playful, but gambling isn't about being artistic - it's about clear transactions. Can you read it quickly? Sort of. Is it as clear as it could be? No. When I install electrical work, inspectors need to see everything clearly documented. If I used fancy handwriting on my diagrams, they'd reject it. Same principle - clarity over style. The colorful backgrounds are fine, but that script font concerns me. Is this a company that prioritizes looking good over being clear? That's not what I want when I'm betting my hard-earned money. Give me clear terms, clear odds, clear withdrawal process - not fancy fonts. Pass.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase clean modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Professional
- A2. What kind of company: Legitimate, well-run platform
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - Professional and transparent
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 5/5 - Perfect fit
- C2. Target audience: People who want clear, honest service

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is the most straightforward and honest. No tricks, just clear design. When I see this, I think "okay, this company knows what they're doing." Clean typography, professional presentation, no nonsense. It's like good electrical work - you don't notice it because it just works properly. The simplicity is a strength. They're not trying to distract you with flashy effects or complicated designs. They're just presenting themselves clearly. That suggests they present their terms clearly too, their odds clearly, their fees clearly. The gradients are subtle and professional - they add visual quality without getting in the way. This is what I want to see. When I'm on my lunch break and I want to place a bet, I don't want to deal with confusing interfaces or hidden terms. This logo suggests they respect their customers enough to be clear and direct. That's trust. Only reason it's 4/5 instead of 5/5 is that I'd need to verify their license and terms, but this makes me want to check - it looks legitimate enough to be worth investigating.

## LOGO 1 (Bold tilted stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Loud
- A2. What kind of company: Marketing-heavy, pushy
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - Too much noise, not trustworthy
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Budget, trying too hard

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Wrong approach
- C2. Target audience: People who fall for flashy advertising

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Too loud, too much going on. The tilted angle, the competing colors, the heavy frames - it's all trying too hard to get your attention. That makes me suspicious. Why do they need to shout at you? Good services don't need to shout. When I bid on electrical jobs, clients trust the contractors who present clear, professional proposals - not the ones with flashy brochures making big promises. This feels like the flashy brochure version. The chaos also suggests they might have chaotic operations. Where's the room for clear licensing information? Clear terms? It'll all get lost in this visual noise. I work with building codes and safety regulations every day - clear communication of rules is essential. This doesn't communicate clarity. It communicates marketing. Not interested.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram abstract)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Unclear
- A2. What kind of company: Trying to look sophisticated, hiding simplicity
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - Can't read it easily, don't trust it
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Trying to look premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Too complicated
- C2. Target audience: Design people, not working people

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Can't read it. Had to look twice to figure out it says something. That's a problem. When you're dealing with money and gambling, everything should be clear. This abstract design hides the message. Why? In electrical work, we have clear symbols and labels for everything - safety depends on it. Same should apply here. If your logo is hard to read, are your terms hard to read too? Are you hiding fees in complicated language? This makes me suspicious. It might look sophisticated to design people, but for regular working people who want straightforward service, it's just confusing. Pass. Give me something I can read and understand immediately.

## LOGO 4 (Bold YES with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Solid
- A2. What kind of company: Traditional gambling operator
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - Decent, but a bit dated
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 3/5 - Okay fit
- C2. Target audience: Older folks, traditional gamblers

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: It's alright. The bold letters are clear, you can read it fine. The shadow effect makes it look more established, which is good for trust. But it also looks a bit dated - reminds me of websites from 10 years ago. Not necessarily bad, but not as clean and modern as it could be. The shadow creates some visual weight, which can suggest substance, but it also adds unnecessary complexity. In electrical design, we've moved toward simpler, cleaner approaches because they're more reliable and easier to maintain. Old complex systems had more points of failure. This isn't bad enough to reject, but it's not as good as the clean, simple approach of Logo 2 or 5. If this were an electrical system, I'd say "it works, it's safe, but could be more efficient." Same here - it's okay, communicates decent trustworthiness, but could be clearer and simpler.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase script friendly)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Amateur
- A2. What kind of company: Small, unprofessional operation
- A3. Trust level: **1/5** - Doesn't look professional enough for real money
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Budget, small

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 1/5 - Wrong for gambling
- C2. Target audience: Very casual people who don't check credentials

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This looks like someone made it in their spare time. The handwritten style is too casual for gambling with real money. When I hire suppliers for electrical parts, I don't work with companies that have amateur-looking branding - it suggests amateur operations. Same here. This doesn't inspire confidence that they have proper licensing, proper security, proper financial controls. It looks like a hobby project, not a legitimate licensed operator. The yellow-green colors and rounded script might be friendly, but friendly isn't what I need when depositing my paycheck. I need professional, licensed, regulated. This doesn't communicate any of that. Would not trust this with my money. Hard pass.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:** Logo 2 and Logo 1

Logo 2 because it's the clear, professional one that made me think "this might be legitimate." When you see good work, you remember it.

Logo 1 because it's the loud, chaotic one that made me think "avoid this." When you see bad work trying to cover itself with noise, you remember that too.

Both stick out - one positively, one negatively. Simple as that.

---

**Bottom Line:**

I'm a simple guy. I want clear, honest, straightforward. Here's my ranking:

**Would Trust (clear and honest):**
- Logo 2 (4/5): Professional, clean, transparent
- Logo 5 (4/5): Clear, direct, no nonsense

**Okay but Not Great:**
- Logo 4 (3/5): Decent but dated

**Don't Trust (unclear or dishonest looking):**
- Logo 3 (2/5): Too fancy, not clear enough
- Logo 1 (2/5): Too loud, trying too hard
- Logo 7 (2/5): Can't read it, don't trust it
- Logo 6 (1/5): Amateur, unprofessional

When I bet on football on weekends, I want to know exactly what I'm dealing with. Clear odds, clear terms, clear licensing. The logo should reflect that clarity. Logo 2 and 5 do that. The others don't. Simple as that.

No hidden surprises, no fancy tricks, just clear honest service. That's what builds trust.
