# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

Oh, this is exciting! I love being part of this. I really enjoy my weekend gaming time, but I'm also very careful about where I play. Working with children has taught me the importance of trust and safety, and I apply that same thinking when choosing gambling sites. Let me share my thoughts!

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive playful style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Fun!
- A2. What kind of company: A friendly gaming company that wants to be approachable
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - I really like this! It's fun AND it feels trustworthy because it's not trying to be something it's not
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5 - Feels current and friendly
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market, accessible

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Love how it communicates fun while staying appropriate
- C2. Target audience: People like me who want entertainment but also responsibility!

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This makes me smile! The playful script says "we're here for fun" which is honest - that's what I want! But here's what's important to me: it still looks professional enough that I believe they take safety seriously. When my colleague recommended a site to me, she emphasized finding one with proper limits and responsible gambling tools. This logo suggests they understand gambling should be FUN, not stressful. The colorful backgrounds are cheerful without being overwhelming. What I love is that it doesn't feel intimidating - some gambling sites have such serious, heavy branding that they make me nervous! This says "come have fun, but we'll keep you safe" and that's exactly what I need. The only thing I'd want to make sure of is that they prominently display their licensing and have good deposit limits. If this logo comes with those features, it's perfect!

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase clean modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Professional
- A2. What kind of company: A very established, trustworthy technology company
- A3. Trust level: **5/5** - This is wonderful! Looks completely trustworthy and safe
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5 - Very modern and sophisticated
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Premium, high quality

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 5/5 - Perfect fit! Professional and responsible-looking
- C2. Target audience: Adults who take responsible gambling seriously

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Oh, I LOVE this one! It's so clean and professional - exactly what I look for when I'm choosing where to play. As someone who works in education, I really value when organizations present themselves professionally because it usually means they operate professionally too. This logo says "we're legitimate, we're licensed, and we take our responsibility seriously" - and that makes me feel so safe! The simple, elegant typography suggests they've invested in doing things right. When I checked that my current platform had proper Spillemyndigheden licensing, it had this kind of professional presentation. The gradient backgrounds are beautiful without being distracting. What makes this especially trustworthy for me is that it doesn't try to manipulate or pressure you - it's calm, confident, and safe. I could absolutely see responsible gambling messages displayed beautifully alongside this logo. It communicates that the company respects their customers and wants them to play responsibly. This would be my TOP choice! It's fun (those nice colors!) but also completely trustworthy. Love it!

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase script friendly)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Sweet
- A2. What kind of company: A small, friendly operation trying to be welcoming
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - It's cute, but maybe too casual for handling my money
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5 - Casual contemporary
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Budget, small operation

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Too casual for real money gambling
- C2. Target audience: Very casual, inexperienced players

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is sweet and friendly, and I appreciate that! But honestly, it's maybe TOO casual for gambling. When I'm depositing money and setting my weekly limits, I need to feel like the company is taking that seriously. This handwritten style is lovely for a craft store or a children's app, but for gambling? I need more professionalism. My concern - and this is important because I've seen friends get into trouble with unregulated sites - is that this doesn't communicate that they have proper licensing and safety measures. It looks like someone's hobby project rather than a licensed operator with responsible gambling tools. I want to have fun, absolutely! But I also want to see that professional edge that says "we're licensed, we have limits, we'll help you stay safe." This is just a bit too casual for my comfort when it comes to money.

## LOGO 4 (Bold YES with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Strong!
- A2. What kind of company: An established, reliable gambling platform
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - This feels solid and trustworthy - I like it!
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5 - A bit traditional but that's not bad
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market to premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Great fit! Feels established
- C2. Target audience: Responsible adults who want reliability

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is really nice! The bold presentation with the shadow effect makes it feel substantial and established - like a company that's been around and knows what they're doing. That gives me confidence! Working in education has taught me to value stability and reliability, and this logo communicates both. It says "we're strong, we're here to stay, and you can trust us" - exactly what I want when I'm setting up my weekend entertainment. The dimensional look makes it feel professional without being cold or intimidating. I love that balance! It's approachable enough that I feel welcome, but professional enough that I trust they have proper licensing and responsible gambling tools. The color variations work well - they're fun and engaging while maintaining that solid, trustworthy feel. My only tiny concern is that it's slightly less modern than Logo 2, but honestly, that traditional feel actually adds to the trust factor! It feels like an established operator who's proven themselves. Would definitely trust this!

## LOGO 5 (Bold with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Clear
- A2. What kind of company: A straightforward, honest gaming platform
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - I like the honesty and clarity here!
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5 - Contemporary and clear
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Very good fit! Direct and trustworthy
- C2. Target audience: People who value straightforward, honest communication

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Oh, this is nice! I really appreciate the thick outline and clear presentation - it feels honest and straightforward, like they're not trying to hide anything. That's so important! When I chose my current gambling site, my colleague emphasized finding one that's transparent about terms and limits. This logo communicates that transparency beautifully. The bold, clear typography says "what you see is what you get" and that's exactly what I want. No tricks, no manipulation, just honest entertainment. The thick outline makes it strong and visible, which I love - it's confident! It's saying "yes!" in a clear, positive way without being pushy or aggressive. The color variations are cheerful and fun, which matches how I feel about my weekend gaming - it's entertainment! But it also maintains that professional edge that tells me they take safety seriously. I could definitely see responsible gambling messages displayed clearly alongside this logo. It's trustworthy, fun, and honest. The only reason it's not a perfect 5/5 is that I slightly prefer the sophistication of Logo 2, but this is definitely a strong second choice!

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram abstract)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Modern
- A2. What kind of company: A contemporary, design-focused tech company
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - It's sophisticated, but I'm not sure what to make of it
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5 - Very contemporary and stylish
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Premium, upscale

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 3/5 - Maybe? It's sophisticated but unclear
- C2. Target audience: Design-conscious younger professionals

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is interesting! It's definitely sophisticated and modern, which suggests a professional operation. I appreciate that! But I have to be honest - it took me a moment to understand what it says. For gambling, I really value clarity because I want to be absolutely sure who I'm trusting with my money. The abstract monogram style is beautiful, don't get me wrong! It's very artistic and contemporary. But when I'm looking for a platform where I'll set deposit limits and play regularly, I want that immediate clarity and recognition. What I DO like is that it looks premium and professional - that suggests they have proper resources and infrastructure. But what concerns me slightly is that abstract designs can sometimes be used by newer companies trying to look more established than they are. I'm not saying that's the case here! Just that it makes me want to verify their licensing extra carefully. If this came with very clear responsible gambling information and proper Spillemyndigheden licensing displayed prominently, I might warm up to it. The sophistication is appealing! But for now, I prefer logos that communicate more directly.

## LOGO 1 (Bold tilted stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Energetic!
- A2. What kind of company: A lively, entertaining gaming platform
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - Fun but maybe a bit too pushy for my comfort
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5 - Contemporary, dynamic
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market, energetic

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 3/5 - The energy is good but maybe too much
- C2. Target audience: People who like excitement and energy

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is certainly eye-catching! It's got energy and excitement, which I appreciate because gambling should be fun! But I have some concerns. The tilted angle and bold colors create a LOT of stimulation, and that makes me a bit worried about whether the platform encourages responsible gambling. Working with children has taught me about overstimulation - sometimes too much excitement can lead to impulsive behavior. When I'm gambling, I want to feel excited but also in control, and this feels like it might push a bit too hard. What I DO like is that it's honest about being entertainment - the bright colors say "this is fun!" and that's okay! But what concerns me is whether a company with this aggressive marketing style would prominently display deposit limits and self-exclusion tools. Would they have those calming, helpful responsible gambling reminders? I'm not sure. The multiple competing color blocks feel a bit chaotic to me. I prefer branding that's fun but also calm and controlled. That said, if this platform had EXCELLENT responsible gambling tools and clear licensing, I might feel differently. The energy isn't bad, it just needs to be balanced with visible safety measures.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:** Logo 2 and Logo 4

Logo 2 stands out because it's just SO beautifully professional! It gave me that immediate feeling of "this is trustworthy and safe" and that's exactly what sticks with me. When I'm choosing where to spend my entertainment money, I remember the ones that made me feel secure.

Logo 4 is memorable because of that strong, dimensional presence. It felt substantial and established, like a company that's proven itself. That confidence is memorable!

Both gave me that wonderful combination of "this looks fun AND safe" which is exactly what I'm looking for!

**My Final Thoughts:**

Oh, this was so much fun to think through! Here's how I'd rank them based on trust and enjoyment:

**My Top Choices (would definitely play here!):**
- Logo 2 (5/5): Perfect professional AND fun - LOVE IT!
- Logo 4 (4/5): Strong, established, trustworthy
- Logo 5 (4/5): Clear, honest, transparent
- Logo 3 (4/5): Fun and friendly while staying responsible

**Mixed Feelings (would need to verify safety features):**
- Logo 7 (3/5): Sophisticated but needs clearer identity
- Logo 1 (3/5): Fun but maybe too aggressive

**Concerns (would want extensive safety verification):**
- Logo 6 (2/5): Too casual for real money

What matters most to me is finding that perfect balance - I want to have FUN (that's why I play!) but I also want to feel SAFE and RESPONSIBLE. The best logos communicate both! They say "yes, come enjoy yourself!" while also saying "and we'll make sure you stay safe while doing it."

I'm so grateful to my colleague who introduced me to licensed, trustworthy sites. It's made all the difference in my enjoyment. I can relax and have fun because I know I'm playing somewhere responsible. That's the feeling a logo should give you - excitement WITH security!

Thank you for letting me share my thoughts! This was really interesting to think about!
