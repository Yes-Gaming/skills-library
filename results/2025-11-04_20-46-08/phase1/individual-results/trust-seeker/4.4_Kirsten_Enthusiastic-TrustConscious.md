[Full response from Kirsten balancing enthusiasm for fun with serious trust concerns. She loved Logos 1 and 4 (both 4/5 trust) for balancing fun with professionalism, and gave Logo 7 a 4/5 for its sophisticated professional look. She was critical of casual/crafty designs that didn't communicate licensing and safety.]
