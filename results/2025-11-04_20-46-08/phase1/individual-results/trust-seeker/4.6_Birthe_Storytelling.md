# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

Thank you for asking my opinion. After teaching for 30 years, I've learned that stories teach us more than numbers do. When I look at these logos, I can't help but think about what happened to my friend Inge last year with that unregulated site. Let me share what I see through those experiences.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase script friendly)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Homemade
- A2. What kind of company: A small, maybe family-run operation
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - Reminds me too much of the site that scammed my friend
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Very budget, small

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Too casual for real money
- C2. Target audience: Very casual, inexperienced people

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This reminds me of what happened to Inge. She found a site that looked friendly and casual like this - handwritten logo, cheerful colors - and she thought "oh, this looks nice and approachable!" But it turned out they weren't properly licensed. When she tried to withdraw her winnings, there were all sorts of problems. It took her three months and help from a consumer advocate to get her money back. The handwritten style is sweet, but my sister always says "if it looks too casual with your money, be careful." This doesn't show me where their license is or that they take security seriously. I need to see professional presentation that says "we follow the rules." This looks like someone's weekend project, not a serious gambling platform. After what Inge went through, I've become very cautious about casual-looking gambling sites.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase clean modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Professional
- A2. What kind of company: An established, trustworthy company
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - This looks like the kind of site my colleague Mette recommended
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Premium, quality

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 5/5 - Exactly what I look for
- C2. Target audience: Responsible adults who want safety

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: When Mette recommended a gambling site to me after Inge's problems, she said "look for one that presents itself professionally - that's usually a sign they're properly licensed." This reminds me of the kind of site she showed me. The clean, simple design says "we're legitimate, we're professional, we follow regulations." My sister's husband works in finance, and he always says you can tell a lot about a company by how they present themselves. This looks like a company that takes things seriously. After Inge's experience, I visited the Spillemyndigheden website to learn about licensed operators, and the good ones all had this kind of professional, clean presentation. The simple typography doesn't try to trick you or hide anything - it's honest. The gradients are beautiful without being distracting. This is the kind of logo that makes me think "I could recommend this to my friends at bingo night without worrying they'll have problems." It reminds me of when I used to teach - the best educational materials were always clean and clear, never trying to manipulate through flashy design. Trust comes from transparency, and this design feels transparent.

## LOGO 1 (Bold tilted stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Loud
- A2. What kind of company: High-pressure marketing company
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - Reminds me of the advertisements Inge clicked on
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Budget, trying to attract attention

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Too pushy
- C2. Target audience: Impulsive people, unfortunately

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is exactly the kind of design that worries me after what happened to Inge. She told me the site she got scammed by had this kind of loud, colorful, tilted logo - it was all energy and excitement. She said "it looked so fun, Birthe, I didn't think about checking if they were licensed." The tilted angle and competing colors create urgency and excitement, which is exactly what responsible gambling shouldn't be about. My sister and I now have a rule when we play our weekly bingo online - if a site's branding makes you feel rushed or overly excited, be careful. Gambling should be calm entertainment, not high-pressure stimulation. This reminds me of when I was teaching - we learned that overstimulating environments make children make poor decisions. The same applies to adults with money! The multiple color blocks feel chaotic. Where would they put their licensing information? Would it be clear? Or would it get lost in all this visual noise? After Inge's experience, I need to see calm, clear branding that leaves room for important safety information.

## LOGO 5 (Bold with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Clear
- A2. What kind of company: A straightforward, honest company
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - Decent, more trustworthy than some
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market, accessible

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Good fit, honest presentation
- C2. Target audience: Regular people who want straightforward service

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This reminds me of something my brother-in-law said when helping me find a safe gambling site after Inge's problems. He said "look for designs that are bold and clear - companies with nothing to hide use bold, simple designs." The thick outline makes everything very visible and straightforward. There's no tricks, no manipulation, just a clear "Yes" in bold letters. My colleague Mette uses a site with this kind of direct branding, and she's never had problems. The clarity is reassuring - you know exactly what you're looking at. The color variations work well because that strong outline keeps everything consistent. What I appreciate is that this doesn't try to overwhelm you or manipulate you - it's just honest and direct. That said, it's not quite as sophisticated as Logo 2. When I compare it to the sites Mette showed me, the really trustworthy ones often have that extra level of polish. But this is definitely better than the casual or chaotic options! It's the kind of logo where I think "okay, this might be alright, but let me check their license carefully first." After what Inge went through, I don't fully trust based on logo alone anymore, but this at least doesn't raise immediate red flags.

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive playful)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Friendly
- A2. What kind of company: A fun, casual entertainment company
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - It's approachable, but maybe too casual
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market, friendly

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 3/5 - The friendliness is nice, but is it serious enough?
- C2. Target audience: People who want fun and friendliness

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This reminds me of a conversation I had with my sister after Inge's problems. We were trying to figure out what makes a gambling site look trustworthy, and my sister said "friendly is good, but it also needs to look professional." This is definitely friendly - the playful script makes me think of the nice handwritten notes I used to write to my students' parents. It's approachable and warm. But when it comes to gambling with real money, I need more than just friendliness. I need to see that professional edge that says "we're licensed, we're regulated, we'll protect you." The colorful backgrounds are cheerful, which I appreciate. But I keep thinking about what my friend Inge says now after her experience - "friendly-looking doesn't mean safe." She wishes she'd looked past the appealing design to check for licensing and regulation. This is better than the very casual handwritten one (Logo 6), because it still has some structure and consistency. But it's not as reassuring as the more professional options. It's the kind of logo where I'd think "this might be fine, but I really need to verify everything carefully" - and after what happened to Inge, that's my approach with everything now anyway.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram abstract)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Confusing
- A2. What kind of company: Trying to look sophisticated, maybe hiding something?
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - I can't read it easily, which worries me
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Premium appearance

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Too unclear for gambling
- C2. Target audience: Young design-focused people

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This makes me think of something that happened to my colleague's daughter. She joined what she thought was a sophisticated investment platform with a fancy, abstract logo like this. It turned out to be problematic. My sister says "when you can't easily read what a company's name is, that's a warning sign." I had to look at this several times to understand it says "YS." For gambling, where I'm trusting a company with my money, I need immediate clarity. After Inge's experience, I've learned that unclear branding can sometimes be used by companies who don't want you to easily find information about them. Now, I'm not saying this company is like that! But the abstract design makes me nervous because it's hard to read and remember. When I tried to help Inge research the company that scammed her, one problem was that their logo was so abstract she couldn't even remember what it looked like to search for reviews. Clear, readable branding is essential for trust. This might work for a fashion company, but for gambling? I need to be able to easily identify who I'm dealing with, easily find their licensing information, easily remember their name to check reviews. The sophistication is lovely, but clarity matters more when it's about money and trust.

## LOGO 4 (Bold YES with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Established
- A2. What kind of company: A traditional, established operator
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - This feels reliable and proven
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market to premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Strong fit, traditional reliability
- C2. Target audience: Older adults who value established companies

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This reminds me of the bingo halls my mother used to visit when I was young - they had this kind of solid, established presentation. The dimensional shadow effect makes it feel substantial, like a company that's been around for years and knows what it's doing. My sister and I often talk about how the sites that have survived for many years are usually the trustworthy ones - they've proven themselves. This has that established feel. After Inge's problems, which were with a new, flashy site, I've come to appreciate traditional, proven presentation. The bold design is confident without being aggressive - it says "we're here, we're stable, you can trust us." This reminds me of the site Mette uses - not the most modern looking, but very reliable. She's been using it for three years with no problems. The color variations maintain that solid, substantial feel. What I particularly appreciate is that this doesn't try to manipulate you through excitement or trendiness - it just presents itself as a solid, established option. It's the kind of logo that makes me think "this company has probably been around for a while and has proper licensing and procedures." It's almost tied with Logo 2 for my trust, just slightly different approaches - Logo 2 says "modern professional," this says "established reliable." Both work for building trust after you've seen friends get hurt by sketchy operators.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:** Logo 2 and Logo 1

Logo 2 stands out because it reminds me of the site Mette showed me after Inge's problems - that calm, professional look that says "we're legitimate." It's memorable because it represents what I'm looking for now when I choose where to play.

Logo 1 is memorable for the wrong reasons - it reminds me of the kind of advertisements Inge clicked on before getting scammed. That chaotic, tilted, colorful approach sticks in my mind as what to avoid.

Both are memorable through my friend's experience - one represents safety, one represents caution. When you've seen someone you care about get hurt, you remember the warning signs.

**My Perspective After Experience:**

After what happened to Inge, I approach gambling sites very differently than I used to. These are my rankings based on trust:

**Most Trustworthy (would recommend to friends):**
- Logo 2 (4/5): Professional, clean, reminds me of properly licensed sites
- Logo 4 (4/5): Established, reliable, proven approach

**Moderate Trust (would verify carefully):**
- Logo 5 (3/5): Clear and direct, but needs verification
- Logo 3 (3/5): Friendly but needs professional credibility

**Concerning (makes me nervous after Inge's experience):**
- Logo 1 (2/5): Too pushy and chaotic
- Logo 6 (2/5): Too casual, like the site that scammed Inge
- Logo 7 (2/5): Too unclear, hard to verify

What I've learned from Inge's experience is that a logo alone doesn't guarantee safety - you must check licensing. But the logo is the first signal about whether a company takes professionalism and regulation seriously. The logos that communicate calm professionalism (Logo 2) or established reliability (Logo 4) make me more confident to then verify their licensing.

My sister and I now have weekly bingo together on a site we carefully researched. The peace of mind from knowing it's properly licensed and regulated has made the entertainment so much more enjoyable. That's what a good logo should do - make you confident enough to do your research, and then deliver on that promise of legitimacy.
