[Birthe's full storytelling-style responses relating trust to personal experiences with friends. She consistently referenced "my sister," "my friend Inge," "my colleague Mette," etc. to ground trust assessments in social proof. Most logos received 2-3/5 trust, with Logo 5 getting 3/5 as the most gaming-appropriate but still lacking visible trust signals she needs after witnessing friends' bad experiences.]
