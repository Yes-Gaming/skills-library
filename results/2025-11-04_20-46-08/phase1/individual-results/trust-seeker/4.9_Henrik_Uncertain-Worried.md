# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

I'm... I'm not sure if I should even be doing this. I've been thinking about maybe trying online gambling, but I'm very worried about security and data privacy. And addiction - that concerns me a lot too. I'll try to share my thoughts, but I'm really not certain about any of this.

## LOGO 1 (Bold tilted stamp/sticker style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Overwhelming
- A2. What kind of company: I'm not sure... maybe too aggressive?
- A3. Trust level: **1/5** - This makes me very worried about impulsive behavior
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5 - Maybe?
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: I think budget? I'm not certain

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 1/5 - I'm concerned this might encourage addiction
- C2. Target audience: Maybe impulsive people? That worries me

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: I'm... I'm very concerned about this one. The tilted angle and all those bright colors - it makes me anxious. What if this kind of design is meant to make you gamble more than you should? I've been researching gambling addiction for months before even considering trying, and this feels like exactly what the warnings talk about. Maybe I'm wrong, but the chaos and energy make me worry about losing control. Where would they show responsible gambling tools? I can't tell. Would they have good deposit limits? The design makes me uncertain. I'm worried about data privacy too - would a company with this kind of aggressive branding take security seriously? I don't know. Maybe it's perfectly safe and licensed, but I can't tell from looking at it, and that uncertainty makes me not want to risk it. I'm concerned that if I started gambling on a platform with this kind of stimulating branding, I might not be able to control myself. That's my biggest fear.

## LOGO 3 (Script/cursive playful)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Friendly, maybe?
- A2. What kind of company: I think casual gaming? Not sure
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - Uncertain if it's professional enough for security
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5 - I think it's current?
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market, I guess

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Maybe too casual for serious security?
- C2. Target audience: Casual people, but is that safe?

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: I'm not sure about this one. The friendly script is less intimidating than some others, which might be good? But then I worry - if it's too friendly and casual, does that mean they're not taking security seriously? I've spent so much time reading about data breaches and identity theft, and I'm really worried about giving my personal information and banking details to gambling sites. Would a company with this casual branding have proper encryption? I don't know. Maybe they would, but I can't tell. The playful style also makes me wonder if they'd have strong responsible gambling tools. Would they take addiction prevention seriously? Or is it all just about making gambling feel fun and easy? I'm concerned about that. On the other hand, maybe the friendly approach means they're more accessible about discussing gambling problems? I'm really not sure. The uncertainty makes me hesitant. I'd want to research this very carefully before trusting it, but even then, I'm not confident I'd feel secure.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded lowercase script friendly)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Very casual
- A2. What kind of company: Small operation? I'm worried about legitimacy
- A3. Trust level: **1/5** - This makes me very nervous about security
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5 - Not sure
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Budget - is that safe?

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 1/5 - Too casual for financial security, I think?
- C2. Target audience: Very casual players - would they check licensing?

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: I'm... I'm really worried about this one. The handwritten casual style makes me think this might be a small operation without proper security infrastructure. Maybe I'm wrong - maybe they're perfectly legitimate and licensed - but I can't tell, and that uncertainty is really concerning to me. I've read so many stories about unlicensed gambling sites that steal people's data or don't pay out winnings, and this casual branding makes me worry this could be one of those. Would they have proper SSL certificates? Would they encrypt my banking information? Would they store my data securely? I don't know, and the casual appearance doesn't give me confidence. I'm also worried about whether they'd have proper addiction prevention tools. If they're this casual about branding, are they casual about responsible gambling too? That really concerns me. Maybe it's completely safe, but I don't think I could bring myself to trust this with my personal information. The uncertainty would keep me awake at night.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase clean modern)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Professional, I think
- A2. What kind of company: Maybe a legitimate, established company?
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - This seems more trustworthy, but I'm still uncertain
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5 - Very modern
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Premium, which might mean better security?

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Seems appropriate, though I'm not certain
- C2. Target audience: People who want professionalism - maybe people like me?

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This one... this one makes me less anxious than the others, though I'm still worried. The clean, professional design suggests maybe they take things seriously? The simplicity is calming - it doesn't try to overstimulate me, which is important because I'm concerned about addiction. Maybe a company that presents itself this professionally would have proper responsible gambling tools? I hope so. The modern, sophisticated appearance suggests they might have good security infrastructure - proper encryption, secure data storage, maybe even two-factor authentication? I'm not certain, but it seems more likely than the casual options. That said, I'm still worried. What if the professional appearance is just marketing and they're not actually secure? What if they don't have good deposit limits? What if I start gambling here and can't stop? The professional look is reassuring, but it doesn't eliminate my concerns completely. I'd still need to spend weeks researching their licensing, reading reviews, checking their security certificates, and understanding their responsible gambling tools before I'd even consider it. Maybe this would be okay, but I'm not confident enough to say definitely.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram abstract)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Confusing
- A2. What kind of company: I can't tell - that worries me
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - Uncertainty about identity concerns me
- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5 - Very modern, I think
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Trying to look premium, maybe?

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Too unclear for me to trust
- C2. Target audience: Design-conscious people? Not cautious people like me

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: I'm... I'm really uncertain about this one. I can't easily read what it says, and that makes me nervous. When I'm considering trusting a company with my personal data and money, I need absolute clarity. If I can't even understand their logo, how can I trust them? Maybe it's a perfectly legitimate company with excellent security, but the abstract design creates uncertainty that I can't handle. What if I wanted to research them - how would I even remember what to search for? "That gambling site with the abstract connected letters?" That's not clear enough for me. I'm worried that unclear branding might mean unclear terms and conditions. Would their privacy policy be clear? Would their data handling practices be transparent? I don't know, and I can't tell from this logo. The sophistication might mean they're professional, or it might just be visual design hiding something less secure underneath. I'm not sure, and that uncertainty would prevent me from ever trying this. For someone as cautious and worried as me, I need absolute clarity and transparency. This doesn't provide that.

## LOGO 5 (Bold with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Clear, I guess?
- A2. What kind of company: Maybe straightforward gambling platform?
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - More clear, but I'm still worried about security
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5 - Contemporary, I think
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 3/5 - Decent fit, maybe?
- C2. Target audience: General people - but does that mean good security?

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: The clarity is... it's somewhat reassuring, I suppose. The bold, clear design means I can at least read it easily, which is better than the confusing options. Maybe clarity in branding means clarity in operations? I hope so. The thick outline suggests straightforwardness, which might mean they'd be transparent about their terms and security practices? I'm not certain. Would they have clear responsible gambling information? Would they make deposit limits easy to find and set? The bold presentation might suggest they would, but I can't be sure. I'm still worried about data privacy - would they protect my personal information? The generic nature of the design makes me uncertain about whether this is an established operator with good security infrastructure or a newer operation. Maybe it's fine, but maybe it's not. The uncertainty really bothers me. I'd need to do extensive research on their licensing, their security certifications, their data privacy policies, and their responsible gambling tools. Even then, I'm not sure I'd feel completely safe. The design doesn't actively make me more worried like the chaotic ones, but it doesn't make me feel secure either.

## LOGO 4 (Bold YES with shadow effect)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Established, maybe?
- A2. What kind of company: Perhaps a traditional operator?
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - Might be reliable, but I'm still uncertain
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5 - Older style
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market, I think

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 3/5 - Seems okay, not sure
- C2. Target audience: Traditional gamblers - but are they secure?

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: The dimensional, established look... maybe that means they've been around for a while? If they've been operating for years, maybe that means they're legitimate and properly licensed? I'm not sure. The traditional style could mean they have established security practices, or it could mean they're using outdated security technology. I don't know enough to tell. Would an established operator be more trustworthy, or would a modern operator have better current security standards? I'm confused about which is safer. The shadow effect makes it look substantial, which might be reassuring, but what if that's just visual design and they don't actually have good infrastructure? I worry about that. Would they have modern responsible gambling tools, or would they be old-fashioned about addiction prevention? I need strong controls to keep myself safe, and I'm not certain whether this traditional approach would provide those. Maybe it would be fine, but the uncertainty makes me hesitant. I'd want to verify everything very carefully, and even then, I'm not confident I'd feel secure enough to actually deposit money.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:** Logo 1 and Logo 2, I think?

Logo 1 because it made me very anxious with all the chaos and stimulation. I remember worrying about whether that kind of design could trigger addiction. The anxiety is memorable.

Logo 2 because it was the one that made me slightly less worried than the others. The professional appearance gave me a small amount of reassurance, though I'm still very uncertain. That slight reduction in anxiety stands out.

Both are memorable through my worry - one amplified it significantly, one reduced it slightly.

**My Overall Assessment:**

I'm... I'm really not sure about any of these. To be honest, none of them made me feel completely secure and safe, which is my main concern. I've been researching online gambling for months, reading about security, addiction, data privacy, and I'm still very uncertain about whether I should try it at all.

If I had to rank them based on how worried they make me:

**Slightly Less Worrying (but still concerning):**
- Logo 2 (3/5): Professional appearance reduces worry slightly, but I'm still very uncertain

**Moderately Worrying:**
- Logo 4 (2/5): Established feel, but many uncertainties
- Logo 5 (2/5): Clear design, but security unclear
- Logo 3 (2/5): Friendly but maybe too casual for security?
- Logo 7 (2/5): Unclear identity creates uncertainty

**Very Worrying:**
- Logo 1 (1/5): Overstimulating, worried about addiction
- Logo 6 (1/5): Too casual, very concerned about security

Honestly, even Logo 2 - the one that worries me least - still makes me anxious. Would they really have proper security? Would they have strong responsible gambling tools? Would my data be safe? Could I set strict limits? I don't know, and the uncertainty is hard to handle.

Maybe I'm just too worried to be gambling online at all. The security concerns, the addiction concerns, the privacy concerns - they all feel overwhelming. None of these logos make me feel confident enough to overcome those worries. I think I might need to research for several more months before I'd even consider trying any gambling platform, regardless of how they look.

I apologize if this isn't helpful. I'm just... I'm very cautious by nature, and gambling involves so much trust and risk that I can't seem to get past my concerns.
