# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

Good. I've viewed all the logos. Here's my honest assessment as Jens.

---

## LOGO 3 (Script style, colorful backgrounds)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Friendly
- A2. What kind of company: Gaming app, maybe for kids
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - Looks approachable but too casual for my money
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5 - Modern enough
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 3/5 - It's okay, bit soft
- C2. Target audience: Younger crowd, casual players

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: The script is friendly but doesn't look serious enough. When I'm betting money, I need to see something more professional. Reminds me of a social app, not a licensed platform.

## LOGO 1 (Bold tilted stamp style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Loud
- A2. What kind of company: Entertainment, maybe too aggressive
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - The tilted angle feels gimmicky
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Too flashy
- C2. Target audience: Young people who like loud branding

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Don't like it. The angled boxes and busy colors make it look like those sketchy sites I avoid. Not trustworthy. Too much going on.

## LOGO 5 (Bold with thick black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Strong
- A2. What kind of company: Gaming platform, straightforward
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - Bold and clear, decent
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

- C2. Target audience: General audience, regular players

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Direct and bold. I appreciate that. The thick outline makes it clear and readable. Still a bit loud with all the colors but more honest-looking than Logo 1.

---

## LOGO 7 (Abstract Y/S connected design)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Confusing
- A2. What kind of company: Tech startup? Not sure

- A4. Modern/dated: 5/5 - Very modern
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Premium attempt

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Doesn't feel right
- C2. Target audience: Tech-savvy younger people

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Don't like abstract designs. Can barely tell what it says. When I'm looking for a licensed platform, I want clarity, not art projects. This feels like it's hiding something.

---

## LOGO 2 (Simple lowercase clean)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Professional
- A2. What kind of company: Legitimate betting platform
- A3. Trust level: **4/5** - Clean and professional, looks trustworthy

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 5/5 - Perfect fit
- C2. Target audience: Adults, responsible players, people like me

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: This is what I'm looking for. Simple, clean, professional. No nonsense. Looks like a legitimate company that has proper licensing. The gradient backgrounds are nice without being flashy. Trustworthy.

---

## LOGO 4 (Bold with shadow/depth)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Solid
- A2. What kind of company: Gaming/betting platform
- A3. Trust level: **3/5** - Decent, bit generic
- A4. Modern/dated: 4/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 4/5 - Good fit
- C2. Target audience: General players

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Bold and clear. The shadow gives it some depth. It's fine - professional enough. Not as clean as Logo 2 but better than the messy ones. Would trust it.

---

## LOGO 6 (Handwritten/script yellow-green)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**
- A1. First word/feeling: Playful
- A2. What kind of company: Casual game app
- A3. Trust level: **2/5** - Too casual for gambling
- A4. Modern/dated: 3/5
- A5. Premium/mass-market/budget: Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**
- C1. Right fit for iGaming: 2/5 - Wrong vibe
- C2. Target audience: Very casual, young players

**D. Open Commentary**
- D1. What works/doesn't work: Too playful. Handwritten style doesn't inspire confidence when I'm depositing money. Looks like a hobby project, not a licensed operator. Pass.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:** Logo 2 and Logo 7

Logo 2 because it's the one I'd actually trust - clean and professional. Logo 7 because I didn't like it - that confusing abstract design stuck in my head for the wrong reasons.

---

**Bottom line:** Logo 2 is the clear winner for me. When I'm gambling, I need to trust the platform completely. Logo 2 looks legitimate, professional, and clean - exactly what I want to see. Logo 1, 6, and 7 would make me suspicious. Logo 3, 4, and 5 are okay but nothing special.
