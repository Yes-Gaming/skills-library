# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

Okay, so I've looked at all the logos now. Let me share my thoughts, though I'm not sure how helpful they'll be...

---

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow on bright colors)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Um, I guess "energetic"? Or maybe "loud"... I'm not sure exactly.

**A2. What kind of company:** It could be a gaming company, maybe? The bright colors make me think of apps or entertainment stuff, but I'm not totally certain.

**A3. Trust level:** Maybe a 3? I guess it looks professional enough, but I don't know... it's hard to say. It doesn't feel untrustworthy, but I'm not completely sure either.

**A4. Modern or dated:** I'd say probably a 4? The colors and style seem fairly modern, I think, but I'm not always great at judging these things.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** I guess it feels more mass-market? Maybe somewhere between mass-market and budget? The bright colors make it feel accessible, but I'm not certain.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** Maybe a 4? It seems like it could work for that kind of thing with all the colors and energy, but I'm not super confident.

**C2. Target audience:** I guess younger people who like casual gaming? Maybe people in their 20s or 30s? But it could appeal to others too, I'm not really sure.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** Well, I think the bright colors are eye-catching, which is good I suppose... The "YES" is pretty bold and easy to read. But maybe it's a bit too bold? I don't know, it might be a little overwhelming with all those bright colors together. Then again, maybe that's the point for a gaming site? I'm not sure.

## LOGO 1 (Angled "YES" in black)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Hmm, maybe "playful"? Or "tilted"... It's kind of dynamic, I guess?

**A2. What kind of company:** Gaming or entertainment, probably? The angled text makes it feel less serious, which could be for fun stuff?

**A3. Trust level:** I'd say around 3? It's okay, I think, but the tilted style makes it feel maybe less professional? Though that might not matter for a gaming company. I'm not sure.

**A4. Modern or dated:** Maybe a 3 or 4? The style seems contemporary enough, but the tilted text is kind of a trendy thing, so it could feel dated eventually? Hard to say.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** I guess mass-market? It doesn't feel super premium to me, but it's not budget either. Somewhere in the middle, maybe?

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** I'd say 3 or 4? It could work, the playful angle might fit gaming, but I'm not completely convinced. It's hard to tell.

**C2. Target audience:** Maybe younger adults who want something fun and casual? People who don't take gaming too seriously? I think?

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The angled text is kind of interesting, I guess... it adds some movement or energy. But I'm not sure if it's too much? Like, it might be harder to read at small sizes? Though maybe that's not a big issue. The black text is bold, which is good for visibility, but I don't know if it stands out enough from the colors behind it sometimes.

## LOGO 5 (Rounded "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** I think "friendly"? Maybe "soft"... It seems more approachable than some of the others.

**A2. What kind of company:** Could be entertainment or maybe something more family-friendly? The rounded letters make it seem less aggressive, I guess.

**A3. Trust level:** Maybe a 3 or 4? It feels more trustworthy to me than some others, though I can't quite explain why. The softer style seems more reliable somehow? But I could be wrong.

**A4. Modern or dated:** I'd say 4? The rounded style feels pretty current, I think, but I'm not totally sure.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, probably? It seems accessible and friendly rather than exclusive or budget.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** Maybe a 3? I'm not sure if it's playful enough for gaming? It feels a bit more general purpose, but it could work. I don't know.

**C2. Target audience:** Maybe a broader audience? People who want something that feels welcoming and not too intense? Could be various ages, I guess.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** I like that it feels friendly and approachable... The rounded letters are easy to read, which is nice. But maybe it's a bit generic? Like, it doesn't stand out as much as some of the others, though that might not be a bad thing. I'm kind of on the fence about it.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Um, "fancy"? Or maybe "elegant"... It's definitely different from the others.

**A2. What kind of company:** I'm not really sure... Maybe something more upscale? The script style makes me think of premium brands, but I don't know if that fits with gaming?

**A3. Trust level:** I'd say 3? The elegant style could go either way - it might seem more trustworthy because it looks professional, or less trustworthy because it seems like it's trying too hard? I can't decide.

**A4. Modern or dated:** Maybe a 3? Script fonts can feel a bit dated sometimes, but this one seems fairly clean. I'm not certain though.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** I guess it's trying to feel premium? The script style suggests that, I think, but I'm not sure if it actually achieves it.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** Maybe a 2 or 3? I'm not sure this style really fits with gaming... It seems more suited for other kinds of businesses? But I could be completely wrong about that.

**C2. Target audience:** Maybe people who want something that feels more sophisticated? Older players, perhaps? Though I'm just guessing.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The script is kind of nice-looking, I suppose... It's definitely distinctive. But I don't know if it fits with the whole "Play Made Easy" tagline? It seems more complicated or formal than "easy," if that makes sense. Then again, maybe the contrast is interesting? I'm really not sure about this one.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" on gradients)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Maybe "calm"? Or "modern"... The gradients are kind of soothing, I guess.

**A2. What kind of company:** Tech company? Or maybe a modern app? The gradient backgrounds and simple text feel very contemporary.

**A3. Trust level:** I'd say 4? It feels pretty professional and modern, which seems trustworthy to me. But I'm not completely certain.

**A4. Modern or dated:** Probably a 5? The gradients and minimal style seem very current, I think. This is the most modern-looking one so far, maybe?

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** I guess it could be premium or mass-market? The clean, minimal style could go either way. It doesn't feel budget, though.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** Maybe a 4? The modern style could work well for a gaming platform, especially if they want to seem current and tech-forward. But I'm not totally sure.

**C2. Target audience:** Probably younger, tech-savvy people? Maybe millennials or Gen Z who appreciate modern design? I think?

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** I like the clean, modern look... The gradients are nice and the lowercase "yes" feels approachable. It's easy to read and seems professional. But maybe it's a bit too minimal? Like, it might not stand out enough in a crowded app store? Though that could also be a strength if they want to seem more sophisticated. I'm torn.

## LOGO 7 (Stylized "S" design)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Um, "abstract"? Maybe "creative"... It's definitely the most unusual one.

**A2. What kind of company:** I'm really not sure... Maybe a tech startup or design agency? It doesn't immediately say "gaming" to me, but I could be wrong.

**A3. Trust level:** Maybe a 2 or 3? It's so abstract that I'm not sure what to think... It could be interesting or it could be confusing. I don't know.

**A4. Modern or dated:** I'd say 4? Abstract designs can feel very modern, but they can also become dated quickly. It's hard to predict.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** Could be premium? The abstract style suggests they're trying to be more artistic or high-end, I think.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** Maybe a 2? I'm not really seeing the connection to gaming... It seems more suited for other industries? But maybe I'm missing something.

**C2. Target audience:** People who like unique, artistic designs? Maybe a more niche, design-conscious audience? I'm really guessing here.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** It's definitely distinctive and creative... The abstract "S" design is interesting from a design perspective. But I'm not sure if it's too abstract for a gaming company? Like, would people understand what it represents? And does it communicate "Play Made Easy"? I don't think so, but maybe that's not important? I'm very uncertain about this one.

## LOGO 6 (Handwritten lowercase "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** I guess "casual"? Or maybe "fun"... The handwritten style is pretty relaxed.

**A2. What kind of company:** Maybe a lifestyle brand or casual gaming? The handwritten style feels informal and friendly.

**A3. Trust level:** I'd say 3? The casual style is approachable, but maybe it's a bit too informal for handling money? Though maybe that's okay for gaming. I'm not sure.

**A4. Modern or dated:** Maybe a 3 or 4? Handwritten styles have been trendy for a while, so it feels contemporary, but I don't know if it will age well.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** I think mass-market? The casual handwritten style doesn't feel premium or budget, just somewhere in the middle.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** I'd say 3 or 4? The casual, fun vibe could work for gaming, especially if they want to seem approachable. But I'm not completely convinced.

**C2. Target audience:** Maybe younger people who want something that feels personal and not corporate? Casual players who aren't super serious about gaming?

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The handwritten style is friendly and approachable, which I think is good... It doesn't feel intimidating or too corporate. But I'm wondering if it might seem a bit too casual for a betting site? Like, is it professional enough when people are spending money? Though maybe that informality is what they want. I'm really not sure. The different colored versions are nice, I guess.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Which logos do you remember best?**

Hmm, let me think... I guess I remember Logo 4 the best? The bold "YES" with all those bright colors really stood out. And maybe Logo 2 with the gradients - that one felt pretty distinctive too. Oh, and probably Logo 7 with the abstract "S" design because it was so different from the others. I think those three stuck with me the most? Though I could be forgetting something.
