# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 3 (Cursive/Script Style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Friendly, casual

**A2. What kind of company:** Honestly, it reminds me of those trendy food delivery apps or maybe a lifestyle brand. The script feels pretty informal.

**A3. Trust level:** 3/5 - It's okay, but I'm not sure my friends would take it super seriously for betting. It looks a bit too casual for handling money, you know?

**A4. Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The script style is pretty current, most people seem to like that handwritten vibe these days.

**A5. Premium, mass-market, or budget:** Mass-market for sure. It's approachable but not fancy.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming:** 3/5 - It could work, but it doesn't really scream "gaming" to me. More like a social app.

**C2. What kind of player/audience:** Probably younger, casual players who aren't too serious about it. People who play for fun more than anything.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The colors are nice and eye-catching, which works well. But honestly, if I showed this to my mates, they'd probably think it looks a bit soft for a betting platform. It doesn't have that edge or excitement you'd want. The cursive is almost too gentle?

## LOGO 6 (Rounded Script Style)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Playful, bubbly

**A2. What kind of company:** This gives me kids' app vibes or maybe a snack brand? Something really light and fun.

**A3. Trust level:** 2/5 - To be honest, I'd be a bit worried what people would think if they saw me using this. It looks almost childish?

**A4. Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The rounded style is trendy but maybe too much? It's bordering on looking like it's for kids.

**A5. Premium, mass-market, or budget:** Budget. It doesn't feel serious enough to be taken as a premium option.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming:** 2/5 - Not really feeling it for betting. Most people would probably think this is for something else entirely.

**C2. What kind of player/audience:** Super casual players, maybe even people who've never gambled before? It's very non-threatening but maybe TOO non-threatening.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The colors are vibrant and catch your eye, that's good. But the rounded, bubbly letters just don't match what you'd expect from a gaming platform. My friends would probably joke about it looking like a cartoon. It doesn't have the credibility I'd want when I'm putting my money in.

## LOGO 1 (Bold Angular Black Boxes)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Bold, loud

**A2. What kind of company:** This screams gaming or sports betting to me. Very energetic and in-your-face.

**A3. Trust level:** 4/5 - Yeah, this looks more legit. The bold style gives it authority. I think most people would feel confident using this.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The angular style with the tilt is pretty modern and dynamic.

**A5. Premium, mass-market, or budget:** Mass-market leaning toward premium. It has that established brand feel.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming:** 5/5 - Perfect fit! This is exactly what you'd expect from a betting platform. It has that excitement and energy.

**C2. What kind of player/audience:** Confident players who know what they're doing. People who are serious about their bets. The guys in my group would probably approve of this one.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The bold black boxes with the angled design really work - it stands out and feels confident. The bright gradient backgrounds add energy. If someone asked me which looks most like a proper betting site, I'd say this one. It wouldn't look sketchy at all on my phone. My only concern is it might be a bit aggressive for some people?

## LOGO 4 (Bold White with Black Outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Energetic, punchy

**A2. What kind of company:** Gaming or entertainment for sure. It has that vibrant, action-packed feel.

**A3. Trust level:** 4/5 - Looks solid and professional. I wouldn't hesitate to show this on my screen in public.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Very current with the bold typography and bright backgrounds.

**A5. Premium, mass-market, or budget:** Mass-market, but quality mass-market. It feels accessible but well-done.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming:** 5/5 - Absolutely fits. The energy and boldness match what you'd want from a gaming platform.

**C2. What kind of player/audience:** Active players who like the thrill. People who want excitement and aren't shy about it. This would work well with my friend group.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The white letters with the black shadow pop really well against those colorful backgrounds - super eye-catching. It feels energetic without being too aggressive. Most people would probably see this as a legitimate, fun platform. The only thing is it might blend in with other gaming brands a bit? But overall, it's strong.

## LOGO 7 (Stylized "S" Intertwined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Trendy, artistic

**A2. What kind of company:** Tech startup or maybe a fashion/lifestyle brand? It's quite stylized and modern.

**A3. Trust level:** 3/5 - It's interesting but maybe too abstract? I'm not sure what my friends would make of it at first glance.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very modern and design-forward. This is definitely following current logo trends.

**A5. Premium, mass-market, or budget:** Premium. It has that boutique, curated feel.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming:** 3/5 - It's stylish but doesn't immediately say "gaming" to me. Most people would probably need to look twice to understand it.

**C2. What kind of player/audience:** Trendy, design-conscious players. People who care about aesthetics. Maybe a younger, hipper crowd?

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The interlocking S design is clever and modern - it definitely stands out as different. The gradient backgrounds are nice. But here's the thing - it's so stylized that it takes a moment to even see it says "yes." For a betting platform, people want to know immediately what they're looking at. It feels like it's trying to be too cool? Like, I appreciate the design, but I'd worry about explaining it to my mates.

## LOGO 2 (Simple Lowercase Gradients)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Clean, simple

**A2. What kind of company:** Could be anything really - tech, apps, services. It's very neutral.

**A3. Trust level:** 3/5 - It's fine but doesn't stand out. Feels a bit generic, and I think most people would just scroll past it.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The gradient backgrounds are trendy, the typography is clean and current.

**A5. Premium, mass-market, or budget:** Mass-market. Very middle-of-the-road.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Fit for iGaming:** 3/5 - It could work but doesn't really excite me. It's missing that gaming energy.

**C2. What kind of player/audience:** Casual, everyday users who just want something simple and straightforward. Not necessarily gaming enthusiasts.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The simplicity is nice - it's clean and modern. The gradients add some visual interest. But honestly, it feels a bit bland for a gaming platform. When I'm looking at betting apps with my friends, we want something that feels exciting and engaging. This feels more like a productivity app or something? It wouldn't look sketchy, but it also wouldn't make me want to share it with anyone.

## LOGO 5 (Bold Rounded with Black Outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Fun, approachable

**C2. What kind of player/audience:** Broad audience - both casual and regular players. People who want fun without intimidation. This would work well for my demographic.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The rounded bold letters are friendly but still confident. The black outline makes it pop nicely against the colorful backgrounds. It strikes a good balance between fun and legitimate - I think most people would see this and feel comfortable using it. It's not trying too hard to be cool, but it's also not boring. The "Play Made Easy" tagline matches this style well. This is probably one I'd feel most comfortable recommending to friends.

## B. RECOGNITION & RECALL

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

Thinking back without looking at them again... I definitely remember **Logo 1** (the bold angular black boxes) - that one really stood out with its aggressive tilted style. **Logo 4** (white with black outline) is also clear in my mind because of how it popped against those bright backgrounds. And **Logo 5** (the rounded one) sticks with me because it felt the most balanced and friendly.

The script/cursive ones (3 and 6) kind of blur together in my memory - they're both curvy and colorful but not super distinctive from each other. Logo 7 with that stylized S design is memorable because it was unique, but more in a "huh, that's different" way than necessarily good. Logo 2 is the one I remember least - it was just too simple and generic to really stick.

So my top recalled: **Logo 1, Logo 4, and Logo 5**.
