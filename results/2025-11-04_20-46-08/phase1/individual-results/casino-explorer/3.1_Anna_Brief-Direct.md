# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Cute
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app or lifestyle brand
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too casual for betting
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Feels trendy but not current
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Doesn't fit. Too playful for casino games
C2. **Target audience:** Young kids maybe? Not casino players

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The script is too soft. Casino games need bold visuals. This feels like a greeting card, not a gaming platform. The colors are fine but the typography is all wrong. Would skip this in the app store.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Soft
A2. **What kind of company:** Kids app or meditation app
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Don't trust it for gambling
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Safe but boring
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Completely wrong. This isn't for casino games
C2. **Target audience:** People who don't like excitement? Wrong audience

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Too friendly and rounded. I want casino apps to look exciting with sharp graphics. This looks like something for toddlers. The yellow background makes it worse - no visual punch. Pass.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The bold approach feels confident

C2. **Target audience:** Casino players who want visual excitement

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Love the angle - it makes it stand out. The colors are vibrant, which is what I look for in casino apps. Bold type is easy to read. The stamp style feels modern. This would catch my eye in the app store. Works great.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Strong
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or betting app
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Bold but the shadow feels dated
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow effect is old school
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Works for gaming but shadow feels unnecessary
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream casino players

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The bold text is good - strong visual presence. But the shadow effect feels like 2010s design. Casino apps should look current. The colors work well. Would prefer this without the shadow. Still decent though.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confusing
A2. **What kind of company:** No idea - could be anything
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too abstract to trust
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Modern but unclear
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying for premium, feels generic

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Doesn't communicate gaming at all
C2. **Target audience:** Unclear who this is for

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Can't tell what "YS" means. Monogram is too abstract. Casino apps need to be immediately recognizable. This looks like it could be a finance app or anything else. The connected letters are nice as a design concept but don't work here. Miss.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Clean
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - Polished and professional
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very modern and sleek
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market leaning premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - Too subtle for casino games
C2. **Target audience:** Design-conscious users

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Beautiful typography and gradients. As a designer, I appreciate the refinement. But for casino apps, I want more visual excitement. This is too minimal. The gradients are sophisticated but casino players want bold, eye-catching graphics. Good design, wrong category.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - Perfect for casino gaming
C2. **Target audience:** Casino players who want visual quality

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick outline makes the text pop against every background. Great contrast and visibility. Casino games are all about visual impact and this delivers. Bold colors, strong typography, high energy. This is what casino apps should look like. Top choice.
