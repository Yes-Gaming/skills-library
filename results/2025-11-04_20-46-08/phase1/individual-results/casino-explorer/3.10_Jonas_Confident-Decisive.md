# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 2 EVALUATION

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Clean

**A2. What kind of company:** This is a mobile app company or digital service platform. Multiple brands under one umbrella.

**A3. Trust level:** 4 - The design is professional and the multi-brand approach shows organization.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 5 - Very modern. The gradient backgrounds and clean typography are current.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market. This is accessible, not trying to be exclusive.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Right fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4 - It works well. The colorful approach fits entertainment, though it's maybe a bit too corporate.

**C2. Target audience:** Everyday mobile users, 25-40, who want simple, straightforward gaming without complications.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The simplicity works perfectly - no wasted space, clear branding. The gradient backgrounds are eye-catching on a phone screen. What doesn't work is it might be too generic - looks like it could be any app company. But honestly, that's a minor issue. This is efficient design.

## LOGO 7 EVALUATION

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Creative

**A2. What kind of company:** This is a tech startup or creative agency. The intertwined letters suggest innovation.

**A3. Trust level:** 3 - It's interesting but feels less established. The playful design makes me question if they're serious about business.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 4 - Modern, but the connected letters trend has been around a while.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** Premium-leaning. This is trying to stand out as something different.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Right fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2 - Not really. The interlocked letters don't communicate gaming or entertainment clearly enough.

**C2. Target audience:** Younger crowd, 20-30, who care about brand aesthetics and "cool" factor over substance.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The color variations work well across different sections. What doesn't work is the logo itself - too clever for its own good. I want to get in, place my bets, and get out. This design is asking me to spend time figuring out what the letters are. Inefficient.

## LOGO 4 EVALUATION

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Energetic

**A2. What kind of company:** This is definitely a gaming or entertainment company. The bold, comic-style text screams action.

**A3. Trust level:** 3 - It's fun but maybe too aggressive. Makes me wonder if they're compensating for something.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 3 - The style is somewhat dated. Reminds me of early 2000s gaming graphics.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market to budget. This is not premium at all.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Right fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4 - Yes, it fits the entertainment/gaming space well. The bold style matches the energy of casino games.

**C2. Target audience:** Casual gamers, 20-35, who want excitement and don't take things too seriously.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The boldness and energy work - it definitely catches your eye. The black outline makes it stand out on any background. What doesn't work is it feels a bit dated and loud. It's trying too hard. I prefer something more sophisticated that doesn't shout at me.

## LOGO 6 EVALUATION

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Friendly

**A2. What kind of company:** This is a casual gaming platform or social entertainment app. The handwritten style feels personal.

**A3. Trust level:** 2 - The handwritten font makes it feel amateur. I need to trust a platform with my money.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 3 - Handwritten fonts have been trendy, but this execution feels a bit basic.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget. This looks like a startup on a tight budget.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Right fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2 - Not really. The casual, handwritten approach doesn't inspire confidence for betting real money.

**C2. Target audience:** Very casual players, maybe women 25-40, who play social casino games for fun without real money.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The friendly approach works if you want to seem approachable. What doesn't work is everything else - it lacks the professionalism I need from a platform handling my money. The script is hard to read quickly on a phone, which wastes my time.

## LOGO 1 EVALUATION

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Bold

**A2. What kind of company:** This is a gaming or sports betting company. The tilted box and bold text suggest action and movement.

**A3. Trust level:** 4 - The bold, clear design feels confident and established.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 4 - Modern. The tilted frame is dynamic without being gimmicky.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market. This is accessible but with quality.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Right fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5 - Perfect fit. The design communicates gaming/betting clearly without being over the top.

**C2. Target audience:** Serious players, 25-45, who know what they want and expect a quality platform.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** Everything works here. The tilted frame adds energy without being chaotic. The bold "YES" is easy to read instantly. The color variations work perfectly for different sections. This is exactly what I want - clear, professional, efficient. No time wasted.

## LOGO 3 EVALUATION

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Soft

**A2. What kind of company:** This is a lifestyle brand or wellness app. The elegant script suggests sophistication.

**A3. Trust level:** 3 - It's pleasant but doesn't inspire confidence for gaming.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 4 - The script style is currently trendy.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** Premium-leaning. This is trying to be upscale.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Right fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1 - Not at all. This looks like a beauty product or yoga app, not a gaming platform.

**C2. Target audience:** Women 30-50, looking for elegant, refined experiences. Definitely not the typical gaming crowd.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The elegance works if you're selling perfume or skincare. For gaming, it completely misses the mark. The script is hard to read quickly, and the whole vibe is wrong. I want action and efficiency, not sophistication. This would make me look for a different platform immediately.

## LOGO 5 EVALUATION

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

**A1. First word/feeling:** Strong

**A2. What kind of company:** This is a gaming or entertainment brand. The bold text with heavy outline suggests impact.

**A3. Trust level:** 4 - The solid, bold design feels trustworthy and established.

**A4. Modern or dated:** 4 - Modern. The bold typography trend is current.

**A5. Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market. This is quality without being pretentious.

**C. Fit & Relevance**

**C1. Right fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5 - Absolutely. The bold, clear design fits perfectly with gaming and betting.

**C2. Target audience:** Confident players, 25-45, who want a solid, reliable platform without unnecessary frills.

**D. Open Commentary**

**D1. What works/doesn't work:** The boldness works perfectly - it's instantly recognizable and easy to read on any screen size. The thick outline ensures it stands out. The color variations are effective. This is efficient, professional design. My only criticism is it's similar to Logo 1, so they might compete with each other in memory.

---

## B. RECOGNITION & RECALL

**B1. Logos I remember best:** Definitely Logo 1 and Logo 5. The bold, tilted designs stuck with me immediately. Logo 7 is also memorable because of the unusual interlocked letters, though I didn't like it. The script ones (3 and 6) blur together in my mind - too similar and forgettable.
