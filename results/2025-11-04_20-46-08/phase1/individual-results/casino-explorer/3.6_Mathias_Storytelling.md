# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Adventurous
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform with personality
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The energy feels authentic and bold
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Has that modern stamp-of-approval vibe
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with character

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - The dynamic angle captures gaming excitement perfectly
C2. **Target audience:** Casino players who want adventure and excitement in their gaming

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This logo reminds me of the stamps I collect in my passport when I'm traveling - each one is a bold declaration of "YES, I was here!" and that's exactly what this design captures. The tilted angle makes me think of those moments when you're about to try something new and exciting, like when I decided to try the night markets in Bangkok or explore the casinos in Macau. There's this feeling of anticipation and energy that the rotation creates - it's not sitting still, it's moving forward into an adventure. I love how each gradient background tells a different story - the purple one feels like night gaming in Las Vegas, the orange is like sunset slots in Monaco, the pink has that Miami Beach casino energy. The stamp aesthetic has this authentic, "been there, done that" quality that makes me think of collecting experiences, which is exactly what exploring different casino games is about. When I'm browsing through new slot games, I'm looking for ones that feel like they'll take me on a journey - Egyptian tombs, Norse mythology, Asian temples - and this logo has that same adventurous spirit. The bold "YES" is like saying yes to new experiences, yes to trying that game with the interesting theme, yes to the excitement of discovery. It's got personality and confidence without being aggressive. This would definitely catch my eye in the app store because it looks different from the standard square logos - it's got that "I'm going my own way" vibe that travelers appreciate.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Powerful
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform that knows what it's doing
A3. **Trust level:** 5/5 - The confidence is reassuring
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Contemporary and impactful
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market but quality-focused

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - Absolutely perfect for casino gaming
C2. **Target audience:** Casino explorers who value visual quality and game variety

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** When I was in Tokyo, I noticed how the best gaming arcades all had this incredible visual impact - bold neon signs, high-contrast graphics, colors that just jumped out at you from blocks away. This logo has that same energy. The thick black outline reminds me of the way street artists in Berlin create murals - they use heavy outlines to make sure their work stands out against any background, any environment. That's what this does - no matter which gradient you put it on, the "Yes" is unmistakable. I love that the variety of backgrounds mirrors the variety of games you'd want from a casino platform. It's like how when I travel, I don't want to eat at the same restaurant every night - I want Vietnamese one night, Italian the next, street food the night after. The visual variety here suggests that same kind of diversity in gaming experience. The word "Yes" itself tells a story of positivity and affirmation - it's saying yes to the next adventure, yes to exploring new games, yes to the excitement. In Barcelona, there's this famous casino with incredibly bold, colorful design that draws you in, and this logo has that same magnetic quality. The visual quality is important because when you're exploring casino games, you want to know that the platform takes design seriously - if the logo looks this good, the games probably have amazing graphics too. This feels like a brand that would offer those visually stunning slots with rich themes and detailed artwork. It's confident without being arrogant, bold without being harsh, eye-catching without being gimmicky.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Casual
A2. **What kind of company:** Social or lifestyle app
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too informal for a gaming platform
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The script feels a bit trendy in a dated way
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Doesn't match the excitement of casino gaming
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users, doesn't feel right for game explorers

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This reminds me of those tourist trap cafes you find in every city - the ones with handwritten chalkboard signs trying to look authentic and friendly, but they're actually just generic. The script is trying to be personal and approachable, but it ends up feeling lightweight and unmemorable. When I think about the casinos I've visited in my travels - from Monte Carlo to Singapore's Marina Bay Sands - they all had this sense of grandeur and excitement. This script doesn't capture any of that. It's like comparing a postcard to actually being there - the script is the postcard version, flat and superficial. Casino games, especially the visually rich slots I love exploring, need bold graphics and strong visual presence. This feels more like a note you'd leave for a roommate than a brand for an exciting gaming experience. The flowing letters remind me of beach resort signage - pleasant but forgettable. When I'm looking for new casino games to try, I want something that promises adventure and visual spectacle, like discovering a hidden temple in Cambodia or watching the northern lights in Iceland. This script promises a mild afternoon, not an exciting journey. The gradients try to add energy, but the typography is working against them. It's like trying to make a travel vlog exciting by adding music when the footage itself is boring - the foundation needs to be strong first.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Mysterious
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything - that's the problem
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The mystery feels intentional, which makes me suspicious
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Minimal and modern
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying for premium but feels generic

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Doesn't communicate gaming at all
C2. **Target audience:** Unclear - the abstraction hides the purpose

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This reminds me of trying to find a restaurant in a foreign city where all the signs are in a language I don't understand - there's this moment of confusion and uncertainty. The "YS" monogram requires you to puzzle out what it means, and while sometimes mystery can be intriguing (like when I stumbled upon that hidden speakeasy in Prague), in this case it just creates friction. When I'm browsing for casino games or apps, I want immediate clarity about what I'm getting. The best travel experiences happen when you know exactly what you're signing up for - that sunset boat tour in Santorini was amazing because it was clearly marketed, not mysteriously hidden. This logo feels like it's trying to be sophisticated by being vague, but sophistication should enhance communication, not obscure it. The connected letterforms are nice from a pure design perspective - they remind me of Arabic calligraphy I saw in Morocco, where letters flow together beautifully. But there, the script is part of the culture and tells a story. Here, it just tells me "we couldn't decide on a clear identity." For casino gaming where visual excitement and game variety are key, this minimal abstraction suggests the opposite - limited, unclear, possibly boring. It's like a travel brochure that's all minimalist white space with no photos - yes, it looks clean, but you have no idea if the destination is exciting or worth visiting. The gradients provide some color interest, but they can't rescue a monogram that fundamentally doesn't communicate what the platform offers.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Elegant
A2. **What kind of company:** Premium entertainment or lifestyle platform
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The polish suggests quality
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very contemporary and refined
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Premium positioning

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - Beautiful but missing gaming energy
C2. **Target audience:** Design-conscious users who appreciate aesthetics

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This logo reminds me of the boutique hotels I stay at in Copenhagen or Stockholm - everything is beautifully designed, minimal, sophisticated, with carefully chosen color palettes. It's the kind of aesthetic you find in design museums or high-end galleries. The lowercase "yes" has this quiet confidence, and the gradient transitions are smooth and well-crafted, like watching sunset over the Mediterranean where colors blend seamlessly. I really appreciate the design quality here - as someone who blogs about visual experiences, I can recognize excellent execution. However, there's a mismatch between this refined elegance and what I look for in casino gaming. When I explore casino games, I want the visual equivalent of exploring the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul or the markets in Marrakech - color, energy, variety, excitement, things that catch your eye from every direction. This logo is more like a minimalist Nordic interior - beautiful, but calm and understated. The slots I love playing have elaborate themes - ancient Egypt with golden pyramids, Asian gardens with cherry blossoms, adventure games with treasure maps. They're visually rich and exciting. This refined approach feels like it's holding back instead of celebrating that excitement. It's like the difference between a museum gallery and a carnival - both can be quality experiences, but they serve different purposes. For casino gaming, I want the carnival energy. This is too gallery-like. That said, if I saw this in the app store, I'd probably click on it because it looks professionally made, but I might be disappointed if the inside doesn't deliver the visual excitement that casino game variety promises.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gentle
A2. **What kind of company:** Children's app or wellness platform
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too soft for casino gaming
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Safe but uninspiring
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Completely wrong energy for casino games
C2. **Target audience:** People avoiding excitement, which is opposite of casino gamers

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This reminds me of those wellness retreat signs you see in Bali - all soft curves, gentle colors, promising calm and relaxation. Which is lovely if you're doing yoga or getting a massage, but completely wrong if you're looking for the excitement of casino gaming. When I visit gaming destinations - Las Vegas, Macau, Monaco - the visual language is bold, bright, energetic, stimulating. This rounded script is the opposite - it's soothing, gentle, almost sleepy. It's like comparing the energy of Carnival in Rio to a quiet meditation session - both valid experiences, but totally different purposes. The rounded letterforms tell a story of safety and comfort, like a children's bedtime story. But casino gaming should feel like an adventure story - exciting, visually rich, full of possibility. The white text on yellow background particularly bothers me - it's like those washed-out photos you sometimes take when the lighting is wrong; there's no punch, no clarity, no impact. When I'm scrolling through casino games looking for something new to try, I want bold graphics that promise visual spectacle - games set in ancient temples with golden treasures, underwater worlds with vibrant sea creatures, space adventures with neon cosmic effects. This soft, rounded approach suggests none of that excitement. It's telling a story about being harmless and gentle, when casino gaming should be telling stories about adventure and discovery and visual wonder. The disconnect is so severe that I'd probably skip right past this in the app store, thinking it was a kids' learning app or meditation timer.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dated
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform using older design trends
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Bold but the shadow undermines it
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow effect feels from a different era
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - The boldness fits but execution feels old
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream users who aren't design-focused

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The drop shadow reminds me of visiting older casinos in Atlantic City or Reno - places that were cutting-edge in the '90s or early 2000s but haven't updated their aesthetic. There's this nostalgic quality to it, and not in a good vintage way, more in a "hasn't kept up with the times" way. When I travel, I love discovering places that honor their history while staying current - like how Barcelona preserves Gaudi's architecture while having ultramodern buildings too. This logo feels stuck in one era. The shadow is trying to create depth and make the text pop, like those old 3D movie effects where things would jump out at you. But modern design has moved past that - now we create depth through subtle gradients, transparency, or clean layering. The heavy shadow here feels like it's trying too hard, like a tour guide who's overly enthusiastic to compensate for a boring tour. The all-caps "YES" and bold typography are strong foundations - they remind me of the confident signage you see in Tokyo's gaming districts, direct and impactful. But then the shadow adds this dated layer that undermines the modernity. It's like wearing a sharp modern suit with outdated shoes - the foundation is there but one element throws off the whole look. The gradient backgrounds are contemporary and work well, which creates this tension between old (shadow) and new (gradients). For casino gaming where visual quality matters and players are exposed to cutting-edge game graphics daily, this dated effect would make me question whether the platform's games are equally behind the times. I want to explore new, visually stunning games, and this logo doesn't promise that journey.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted stamp is unforgettable because it breaks the pattern. It's like remembering that one street in Amsterdam that goes diagonal when all the others are straight - the uniqueness creates the memory. The dynamic angle tells a story of adventure.

**Logo 5** - The thick black outline creates such strong visual impact that it's impossible to forget. It's like those iconic signs you remember from cities - Tokyo's neon, Las Vegas's lights - bold enough to stay in your memory long after you've seen them.

**Logo 2** - I remember this for its refinement and design quality, even though I think it's too subtle for casino gaming. It's memorable the way a really beautiful minimalist building is memorable - it stands out through quality rather than volume.

The script logos (3 and 6) blend together in my mind because they're both telling similar stories of casual friendliness that don't fit casino gaming. Logo 7 I remember being confused by - like arriving at a train station where all the signs are in a script you can't read. Logo 4 is memorable for the wrong reasons - the dated shadow effect sticks out like finding a flip phone in a smartphone store. Overall, Logos 1 and 5 tell the most compelling stories for casino gaming - they promise adventure, visual quality, and excitement, which is exactly what casino explorers want.
