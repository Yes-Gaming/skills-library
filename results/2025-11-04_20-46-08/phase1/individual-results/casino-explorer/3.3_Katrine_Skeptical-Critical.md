# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Aggressive
A2. **What kind of company:** Betting or gaming app trying too hard
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The heavy shadow feels manipulative, like it's compensating for something
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - Drop shadows are outdated design tricks
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market trying to look premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - Fits the aggressive nature of gambling marketing
C2. **Target audience:** People who respond to loud, pushy design - not me

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This logo feels like it's shouting at me, which makes me immediately suspicious. From a psychological perspective, the heavy drop shadow is a design tactic meant to create perceived depth and importance, but it comes across as overcompensation. When brands use excessive visual effects, it often signals they're trying to mask weak core value. The all-caps "YES" is affirmative language, which is a classic psychological manipulation technique in gambling - you're priming users to say yes, to agree, to accept. I'm skeptical of how this would be used in the actual app. Would there be "YES" buttons everywhere pushing me to make bets I don't want to make? The shadow adds unnecessary visual complexity that feels dated, like they hired a designer who hasn't updated their skills since 2010. The gradients are fine, but paired with the shadow effect, it's just too much. This feels designed to grab attention through volume rather than quality, which is exactly the kind of manipulative approach I expect from gambling platforms.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Deceptive
A2. **What kind of company:** Something pretending to be friendly while taking your money
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - Extremely suspicious of the friendly facade
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Trying to look approachable but feels calculated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget masquerading as friendly

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This is psychological manipulation disguised as friendliness
C2. **Target audience:** Vulnerable people who are susceptible to friendly-looking scams

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is exactly the kind of design that makes me distrust gambling apps. The rounded, soft letterforms are clearly designed to appear non-threatening and friendly, which is a classic psychological tactic to lower people's defenses. In psychology, we study how companies use "friendliness" as a facade to make people feel safe while engaging in risky behavior. This rounded script is saying "we're harmless, we're your friend," but gambling is never harmless - it's a business designed to take your money. The soft curves are meant to trigger the same neural responses as seeing a baby's face - round equals safe, unthreatening. But applying this to a gambling platform is ethically questionable. Are they using friendly design to make people forget they're risking real money? The yellow gradient background reinforces this false cheerfulness. I'm especially suspicious of why a casino gaming platform would choose to look like a children's app. Is it targeting younger users who might not recognize gambling risks? Or trying to make gambling feel as innocent as playing a game for kids? Either way, the disconnect between the friendly visual language and the reality of gambling makes me deeply distrustful of the intentions behind this design.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Polished
A2. **What kind of company:** Tech platform trying to seem sophisticated
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The refinement is nice but feels like a distraction
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very current, which could be calculated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Premium positioning to justify higher costs

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Too subtle for casino games, which makes me wonder what they're hiding
C2. **Target audience:** Design-conscious people who might overlook the gambling aspect because it looks nice

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I appreciate good design, but I'm suspicious of why a gambling platform would invest so heavily in looking sophisticated and minimal. In psychology, we learn about "legitimacy facades" - when potentially harmful businesses use professional aesthetics to appear more trustworthy than they deserve to be. This refined, minimal design could be a deliberate strategy to distance the brand from the negative associations people have with gambling. By looking like a premium tech product instead of a casino, they're potentially trying to attract users who wouldn't normally gamble. The lowercase treatment and sophisticated gradients say "we're not like those other gambling apps," but at the end of the day, the business model is the same - they make money when users lose. I'm skeptical of the mismatch between this clean, minimal aesthetic and the reality of casino gaming, which is designed with bright colors and flashy graphics specifically to trigger dopamine responses. If this is their logo, what does the actual app look like? Are they hiding the manipulative game design behind a sophisticated interface? The design itself is well-executed, but that almost makes me more suspicious because it means they have resources to invest in psychological design tactics.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Pushy
A2. **What kind of company:** Aggressive marketing-driven gambling platform
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The tilt feels unstable and the stamp feels like pressure
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Trendy, which might be calculated to appeal to younger users
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with aggressive tactics

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Unfortunately fits the aggressive nature of gambling marketing
C2. **Target audience:** Impulsive people who respond to energetic, pressuring design

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted angle immediately makes me think of pressure tactics. In psychology, we know that urgency and instability are used to trigger impulsive decisions. The stamp aesthetic suggests "approved" or "confirmed," which could be a psychological tactic to make users feel like gambling is a validated choice. The rotation creates visual tension that doesn't let your eye rest - it's designed to grab attention, but that constant stimulation can be mentally exhausting. I'm skeptical of why they'd choose an unstable angle for a platform where people are making financial decisions. Is it intentionally designed to keep users in a heightened, less rational state? The bold "YES" is affirmative language that's constantly reinforcing positive responses, which is a known manipulation tactic in gambling design. From a critical perspective, this feels like it's designed to bypass rational thinking and trigger emotional, impulsive responses. The energy and dynamism might appeal to some people, but to me it signals a platform that's more interested in activation than user welfare. I'd want to know more about their responsible gambling features before trusting a brand with this kind of aggressive visual language.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Loud
A2. **What kind of company:** Mass-market gambling trying to dominate attention
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The heavy outline feels like it's shouting for attention
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Current trend but used aggressively
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with high-volume tactics

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Fits because gambling apps use loud design to trigger engagement
C2. **Target audience:** People susceptible to high-stimulation marketing

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The thick black outline is maximum contrast, maximum attention-seeking, maximum volume. From a psychological perspective, this kind of design is meant to dominate your visual field and override other stimuli. In studies of gambling design, we see that high-contrast, bold visuals are specifically used to trigger arousal and excitement, which correlates with increased gambling behavior. I'm skeptical of any gambling platform that uses this level of visual aggression because it signals they're prioritizing engagement over user wellbeing. The outline makes it impossible to ignore, which might be the point - they want to stay top-of-mind so users keep coming back. The gradient backgrounds add even more stimulation. While some might see this as exciting visual design, I see it as calculated psychological manipulation. Every design choice here is about grabbing and holding attention, which in the gambling context means keeping people playing longer. The boldness could also be compensating for lack of substance - if the games or platform features were truly compelling, would they need such aggressive visual tactics? I'm particularly suspicious of how this would be used within the app itself. Would every button and call-to-action have this same loud, impossible-to-ignore treatment? That would create an environment designed to pressure users into continuous engagement, which is ethically concerning.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Unclear
A2. **What kind of company:** Trying to hide what they actually do
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The abstraction feels like intentional obscurity
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Modern minimalism can be a cover
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Attempting premium to mask gambling nature

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Deliberately doesn't communicate gambling, which is suspicious
C2. **Target audience:** People who want to gamble but feel ashamed about it

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This monogram is so abstract that I immediately wonder what they're trying to hide. Why would a casino gaming platform choose a logo that doesn't communicate what it does? From a psychological perspective, this could be targeting users who have ambivalence about gambling - they want to do it, but they don't want it to be obvious on their phone screen or in their bank statements. The abstract "YS" letterforms give them plausible deniability. If someone sees the app icon, they can't immediately tell it's a gambling app. This kind of discretion-focused design is common in industries that carry social stigma. I'm skeptical of the intentions here. Is this designed to help people hide their gambling from family or friends? Is it meant to bypass internal ethical concerns people might have? The minimalist, sophisticated aesthetic could also be a way to make gambling feel more acceptable or intellectual than it actually is - "I'm not gambling, I'm using this refined, design-forward platform." The thin connecting strokes and abstract nature mean most people won't recognize this as casino gaming, which seems like a deliberate choice. From a critical psychology standpoint, any time a company obscures what it actually does, I question their motivations. Transparent, ethical businesses are clear about their identity. This abstraction feels calculated.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Manipulative
A2. **What kind of company:** Gambling dressed up as casual fun
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - The casual script feels designed to lower defenses
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts come and go, this feels calculated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget trying to seem approachable

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - The mismatch is suspicious - why make gambling look casual?
C2. **Target audience:** Young people who don't recognize gambling risks

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This script treatment is a red flag for me. The flowing, handwritten quality is designed to feel personal, friendly, and casual - but gambling is none of those things. It's a commercial transaction with real financial risk. The disconnect between the friendly script and the reality of casino gaming suggests psychological manipulation. In my psychology studies, we've examined how companies use casual, friendly design to normalize risky behaviors. By making gambling look as innocent as a handwritten note, they're potentially targeting users who wouldn't engage with obviously "gambling-looking" platforms. I'm especially concerned about age targeting here - this script style is popular with younger demographics, and it makes the platform look more like a social app than a casino. Is this intentional? Are they trying to attract younger users by disguising the gambling nature? The contrast between the bold gradient backgrounds and the soft script also bothers me - it's like they can't decide whether to be bold and exciting (honest about being gambling) or soft and friendly (pretending to be something else). This inconsistency makes me distrust the entire brand. If they're inconsistent in visual language, are they inconsistent in ethical standards? The script style also has poor readability, which could be another psychological tactic - if users can't easily read terms and conditions or odds information presented in this typeface, they might make less informed decisions.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 6** - I remember this specifically because the friendly facade over gambling content disturbed me. The cognitive dissonance creates strong memory.

**Logo 5** - Impossible to forget because it's designed to dominate attention. I remember it, but not in a positive way - I remember feeling visually assaulted.

**Logo 4** - The aggressive shadow effect stood out as a dated manipulation tactic.

I'm suspicious that I remember the most aggressive and manipulative designs best, which proves they're effective at grabbing attention - but effectiveness doesn't equal ethics. The quieter logos like 7 and 2 are less memorable, which could be intentional obscurity. Overall, every logo here triggers some form of psychological concern about gambling design tactics.
