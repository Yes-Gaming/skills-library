# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Abstract
A2. **What kind of company:** Tech startup or software company
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The abstraction creates uncertainty about what the company actually offers
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The monogram approach is contemporary
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Attempting premium but feels generic

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - The abstract nature doesn't communicate gaming effectively
C2. **Target audience:** Users who prioritize minimalism over clarity, which isn't typical for casino gamers

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a game design perspective, this logo fails to communicate its purpose clearly. The "YS" letterforms are connected in an interesting way from a typography standpoint - the curves flow well and there's good negative space usage. However, as someone who develops games, I know that visual communication is critical. Casino game players are drawn to immediate visual stimulation and clear messaging about what they're getting. This monogram requires cognitive processing to understand what it represents, and that's a friction point. The gradient backgrounds are well-executed technically - smooth transitions, good color selection - but they're doing all the heavy lifting here while the monogram itself remains cryptic. At app icon size, those thin connecting strokes will likely become illegible, creating even more ambiguity. The design philosophy here seems to be "less is more," but in the casino gaming space, where visual excitement and game variety are key value propositions, this minimalist approach misses the mark.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Sophisticated
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment platform or streaming service
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The refinement suggests professional execution
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very current design language
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with premium positioning

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It works from a quality standpoint but lacks gaming energy
C2. **Target audience:** Design-conscious millennials and Gen Z who value aesthetics

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is well-crafted from a pure design execution perspective. The typography demonstrates good kerning and proportion - the lowercase "yes" has balanced letterforms with consistent stroke weight. The gradients show technical competence with smooth color transitions and thoughtful hue selection. From a game developer's viewpoint, I can appreciate the clean, minimal aesthetic. However, when I think about casino game players - the people who are attracted to slot games with elaborate themes, rich graphics, and visual excitement - this feels too restrained. The design is saying "sophisticated" and "refined," but casino game discovery is driven by visual impact and variety. Players browse through hundreds of game titles looking for something that catches their eye visually. This logo would work beautifully for a meditation app or a premium lifestyle brand, but for casino gaming, it's under-communicating the excitement and entertainment value. The white text on some of those darker gradients also presents potential contrast issues at smaller sizes, which could affect app icon readability. It's technically well-executed, but strategically misaligned with the category needs.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Impactful
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform or entertainment app
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The bold approach communicates confidence
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Contemporary design that's currently trending
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - Strong fit for casino gaming category
C2. **Target audience:** Casino players who value visual quality and game variety

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This logo demonstrates a clear understanding of the casino gaming user base. The thick black outline serves multiple functional purposes - it creates maximum contrast against any background color, ensures legibility at small sizes, and adds visual weight that commands attention. From a game design perspective, I know that casino players respond to bold, high-contrast visuals. When you look at successful slot games, they all use strong outlines, vibrant colors, and clear typography because players need to quickly scan and identify games they're interested in. This logo applies those same principles at the brand level. The gradient backgrounds provide variety and visual interest, which aligns with the "game variety" value proposition that casino explorers seek. Each color variant offers a different personality while maintaining brand consistency through the typography treatment. The "Yes" wordmark is affirmative and positive, which psychologically aligns with the aspirational nature of casino gaming. From a technical execution standpoint, the outline weight is substantial enough to render clearly at icon sizes, and the bold sans-serif typeface won't lose definition when scaled down. The design system is simple enough to be versatile - I can see this working across app icons, loading screens, and in-game branding without losing impact. This is the kind of visual language that would stand out on an app store shelf while communicating energy and entertainment value effectively.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Powerful
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or sports betting platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Bold but the shadow effect raises some concerns
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The drop shadow technique feels like previous design generation
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The boldness fits gaming well
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream casino game players

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Let me walk through the design decisions here. The all-caps "YES" in bold sans-serif is a strong foundation - it's readable, confident, and scales well. The shadow effect is where this gets more complex. From one perspective, shadows add depth and help text stand out from backgrounds, which is useful for visibility. However, the execution here feels like it's borrowing from design trends that peaked around 2012-2015. In game development, we're always balancing between timeless design and current trends, and drop shadows have largely been replaced by more subtle depth techniques like subtle glows or gradient overlays. The shadow here is quite pronounced - it's not a subtle lift effect, it's a heavy drop shadow that adds significant visual weight. At app icon sizes, this additional complexity might actually work against readability rather than enhancing it, because the shadow consumes valuable pixels that could be used for the letterforms themselves. The gradient backgrounds are well-executed and contemporary, which creates an interesting tension with the more dated shadow treatment. It's like the design is straddling two different eras. For casino gaming, where visual excitement is important, the boldness works, but I'd question whether the shadow effect is adding value or just adding noise. It's functional and would certainly be visible, but it's not pushing the design forward in the way that casino game players - who are constantly exposed to cutting-edge game graphics - might expect.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform or event app
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The tilt adds personality but reduces perceived stability
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The stamp aesthetic is currently trending
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The energy and movement fit gaming well
C2. **Target audience:** Casual casino players looking for entertainment value

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted rectangular frame is an interesting design choice that creates immediate visual differentiation. From a game design perspective, I understand the reasoning - the angle implies motion and energy, which aligns with the excitement of casino gaming. The stamp or sticker aesthetic taps into current design trends around authenticity and tactile references in digital design. The bold, all-caps "YES" provides good contrast and readability. However, there are some UX considerations to unpack here. The rotated frame creates an irregular footprint that won't align with the standard app icon grid on mobile devices. While this distinctiveness aids recognition - I'd definitely notice this among rows of standard square icons - it also creates visual tension with the overall interface design language of iOS or Android. Most successful apps work within the system design constraints rather than fighting against them. The tilt angle is significant enough to be noticeable but not so extreme that it feels unstable, which is a careful balance. From a scaling perspective, the frame adds another element that needs to remain visible at small sizes, which could potentially compete for attention with the wordmark itself. The gradient backgrounds work well here, providing the color variety that casino players appreciate. Overall, it's a bold choice that trades some functional optimization for increased memorability, which could work for a brand trying to stand out in a crowded market, though it comes with some technical trade-offs.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gentle
A2. **What kind of company:** Children's app or wellness platform
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too casual for financial transactions
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Plays it safe with rounded forms
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Misaligned with casino gaming category
C2. **Target audience:** Very risk-averse users, possibly children - wrong demographic

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Let me analyze this from a game design psychology perspective. The rounded, flowing letterforms communicate softness, approachability, and safety. In interface design, we use rounded corners and smooth curves to create feelings of friendliness and reduce perceived risk. That's appropriate for certain contexts - children's educational apps, meditation apps, health and wellness platforms - where you want to minimize anxiety and create a welcoming environment. However, casino gaming operates on a completely different psychological principle. Casino game players are seeking excitement, visual stimulation, and the thrill of potential rewards. The game graphics in successful slots are bold, sharp, and visually striking. They use high-contrast colors, detailed artwork, and dynamic animations to create engagement. This rounded script approach is working against those category expectations. The typography itself has technical issues for this use case - script fonts with connected letterforms and varying stroke weights lose legibility at small sizes, which is problematic for app icons. The white text on the yellow gradient background particularly suffers from poor contrast, which would fail accessibility standards. From a professional game development standpoint, I'd advise that this visual language sends signals that are completely mismatched with what casino game players are looking for. It's saying "gentle" and "safe" when the category demands "exciting" and "visually rich." The execution is competent from a design craft perspective, but the strategic direction is fundamentally wrong for this category.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Playful
A2. **What kind of company:** Lifestyle brand or social app
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too informal for a gambling platform
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script trends cycle, this feels slightly past peak
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - The casual nature doesn't fit gambling
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users who prioritize friendliness over excitement

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a game development perspective, let me break down why this doesn't work for casino gaming. First, the typography: script fonts have inherent legibility challenges because of their connected nature and variable stroke weights. When designing game interfaces, one of our primary concerns is ensuring that all text is immediately readable across different screen sizes and contexts. This script typeface would struggle at app icon sizes where every pixel counts. Second, the personality mismatch: the flowing, handwritten quality communicates informality and lightness. In casino gaming, even though we're providing entertainment, we're also dealing with real money transactions. Players need to feel that the platform is professional and secure. This script treatment undermines that confidence by appearing too casual. Third, the design consistency issue: the backgrounds are bold, vibrant gradients that communicate energy and excitement, but the script typography is soft and flowing. These two design languages are working against each other rather than creating a cohesive visual system. In game development, we call this "design dissonance" - when different elements send conflicting messages. Fourth, from a technical rendering standpoint, the thin strokes and curves in this script will likely break down at smaller sizes, potentially causing antialiasing issues that make the text appear blurry or poorly defined. For a casino gaming platform where visual quality directly impacts perceived game quality, this is a significant concern. The concept might work in a different category, but for casino gaming where players are evaluating visual sophistication and game variety, this approach is too lightweight.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 5** - The thick black outline creates maximum visual impact and is immediately memorable. From a design perspective, it's the most confident execution.

**Logo 1** - The tilted frame is distinctive enough to create strong recall. The unusual angle makes it stand out from standard app icon patterns.

**Logo 7** - I remember this because it created a puzzle my brain wanted to solve. The monogram made me pause to figure out what "YS" meant, which creates memory encoding. However, that's not necessarily positive memorability.

**Logo 2** - The refined execution is memorable from a design quality standpoint. As someone who works in design, I appreciate the craft even if I question the strategic fit.

The script-based logos (3 and 6) blend together in memory because they share similar design approaches and both feel misaligned with the category, so they don't create strong individual recall. Logo 4 is memorable for its boldness but the shadow effect feels dated, which creates a mixed impression.
