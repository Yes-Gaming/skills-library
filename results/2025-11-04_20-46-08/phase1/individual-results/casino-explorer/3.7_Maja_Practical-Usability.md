# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Loud
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming app or mobile entertainment platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The bold approach works but feels a bit aggressive. It doesn't scream "trustworthy" but it's not sketchy either.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Modern, but the heavy outline feels like it's trying too hard to stand out on an app store shelf.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, leaning toward budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - It fits because the bold colors and text communicate energy, which works for gaming.
C2. **Target audience:** Young users who want something straightforward. Probably casual gamers, not serious bettors.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The contrast works well for visibility - I can see this being very readable on a phone screen at small sizes, which is important for app icons. But the thick black outline feels excessive. It would work fine functionally, but aesthetically it's a bit much. The gradient backgrounds are fine but nothing special.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Sleek
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment platform, possibly streaming or social
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - This feels more polished and professional. The refinement suggests the company cares about design quality.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very modern. The lowercase, minimal approach is current.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with premium aspirations

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It works, but it doesn't immediately communicate "gaming" to me. Could be any entertainment app.
C2. **Target audience:** Younger millennials and Gen Z who value design aesthetics. Users who want their apps to look good.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is well-executed from a design perspective. The typography is clean, the gradients are more sophisticated than Logo 5. It would look good on my home screen. However, it might be too subtle - at app icon size, the contrast between the white text and some of those darker gradient backgrounds could cause readability issues. The user needs to be able to quickly identify the app, and this might blend in too much.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confused
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything - finance, fitness, fashion?
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The abstraction makes me uncertain about what this company actually does, which affects trust.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The monogram approach is modern, but the execution feels generic.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying to be premium but landing at mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This doesn't communicate gaming or entertainment at all. The connected letterforms are nice as a design element, but they don't tell me anything about the product.
C2. **Target audience:** Unclear. Maybe users who prioritize sophistication over clarity?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a UX perspective, this doesn't work for me. The primary job of a logo - especially for an app - is immediate recognition and communication of purpose. This monogram is too abstract. When I'm scrolling through my phone looking for the app, I need to recognize it instantly. The "YS" doesn't clearly spell "YES" at first glance, which creates cognitive friction. Also, at small sizes, those thin connecting lines might not render well.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Energetic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or entertainment, maybe event ticketing
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The tilted angle gives it personality but also makes it feel less stable/reliable.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The stamp/sticker aesthetic is trendy right now.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The energy and boldness fit well with gaming. The angle suggests action and excitement.
C2. **Target audience:** Casual gamers who want something fun and unpretentious. Probably younger users.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted frame is distinctive, which helps with recognition. That's good UX - I'd be able to spot this quickly on my home screen. However, the angle creates an awkward footprint that won't tile neatly with other app icons. Most apps are designed to work on a standard grid, and this deliberately breaks that. It might look dynamic in isolation but could feel disruptive in context. The bold contrast works well for readability though.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Playful
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app or lifestyle brand
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The script feels too casual for a platform where I'm spending money. It doesn't inspire confidence in security or professionalism.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts can feel trendy or dated depending on execution. This one feels a bit 2018.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This feels wrong for betting. The script is too friendly and lightweight for an industry that involves real money transactions.
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users, maybe younger teens? Not serious players.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a functional standpoint, script typography is problematic at small sizes. The connected letters and varying stroke widths will lose definition when scaled down to app icon size. The user would struggle to read this quickly. Also, the mix of solid backgrounds with script text feels mismatched - the backgrounds are bold and graphic while the typography is soft and flowing. The design language isn't consistent, which suggests the user experience might not be either.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Friendly
A2. **What kind of company:** Kids' app or wellness/meditation app
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too soft and informal for a betting platform
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The rounded script feels safe but unexciting
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget to mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This doesn't match the category at all. It's too gentle and approachable for gambling.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who want something non-threatening, but that's not necessarily what you want from a gaming platform. Maybe very risk-averse casual players?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The rounded letterforms are legible, which is good. But the overall personality is completely wrong for the use case. When I'm using a betting app, I want to feel like the platform is sophisticated and capable, not cute and bubbly. This would make me question whether the backend systems are equally simplistic. The script style also has the same small-size readability concerns as Logo 3. The white text on yellow background has particularly poor contrast - that fails basic accessibility standards.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Strong
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming app or sports betting
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The boldness suggests confidence, but the heavy shadows feel a bit dated.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow effect feels like a 2010s design trend that's fading
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The bold, impactful style fits gaming well. It communicates confidence and energy.
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream gamers who want something straightforward and powerful. Probably skews male.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The high contrast and bold type ensure good readability at any size - that's critical for app functionality. The shadow adds depth, which helps it stand out. However, the shadow effect adds complexity that might not render cleanly at very small sizes, and it feels a bit heavy-handed. It's trying to add dimension but ends up just adding visual weight. The gradient backgrounds do the work of creating interest; the text shadow is redundant. Functionally it works, aesthetically it's overdone.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted rectangular frame is distinctive. It's the only one with that angled approach, so it stands out in memory.

**Logo 2** - The refined lowercase version stuck with me because it felt the most professionally executed from a design perspective.

**Logo 7** - I remember this one because the monogram confused me. When something doesn't make immediate sense, you tend to remember it - though that's not necessarily positive.

The others (5, 4, 3, 6) kind of blur together in my mind because they're variations on the same bold-text-on-gradient theme without distinctive enough differentiators.
