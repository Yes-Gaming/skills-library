# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Shareable
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment platform with social appeal
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The bold, confident vibe suggests a platform my friends would trust and recommend
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Very Instagram-worthy, the tilted aesthetic is trending
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with strong social presence

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - This is exactly what everyone's talking about - platforms that do everything. The bold stamp says "approved by the community" which is huge for social proof. Perfect for sharing wins across sports bets, casino games, esports.
C2. **Target audience:** Social users like my friend group who want to share their experiences. People who are on Discord talking about their bets and game sessions.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a social media perspective, this absolutely works. The distinctive tilted design would look great in screenshots and shares - it's got personality and energy that translates well to Instagram Stories or TikTok. My friends would definitely recognize this logo if I posted about a big win or shared a bet slip. For a unified platform where community is key - comparing sports betting tips, celebrating casino wins together, discussing esports odds - you need a logo that people want to engage with. This has that quality. The only concern: would the angle crop weirdly in some social media formats? But overall, the community would love this. It's got that "yes!" energy that makes people want to participate.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Strong
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform with serious community
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The boldness and shadow suggest a platform with substance that the community backs
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow is a bit retro, but everyone I know appreciates throwback vibes
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with broad appeal

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - Everyone in my network is looking for all-in-one platforms. This logo screams "we've got everything" - sports, casino, esports. The bold approach matches how my friends talk about their favorite platforms.
C2. **Target audience:** The core betting and gaming community. People who share their bet slips, celebrate wins together, discuss strategies in group chats.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** People I know would definitely vibe with this. The bold "YES" is perfect for social engagement - imagine posting a screenshot of a big casino win or a successful parlay with this logo visible. It reinforces the excitement. The shadow adds that extra "pop" that makes it stand out in feeds. My whole friend group migrated to unified platforms because we can share experiences across sports betting, casino games, and esports more easily. This logo looks like it belongs to that kind of platform. Everyone says they want platforms that feel confident and substantial - this delivers. The only thing: is the shadow effect too much for some? But honestly, most people in the community would think it looks solid and trustworthy.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Loud
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile-first gaming with active community
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It's attention-grabbing, which works on social media, but might feel aggressive to some in my network
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The heavy outline technique is very current, lots of apps use this approach
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, designed for volume and visibility

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Everyone's using platforms with bold branding right now. This would definitely stand out in the app stores and in social shares. Works for the unified experience people are demanding.
C2. **Target audience:** Social users who are constantly on their phones, sharing content. The kind of people who have strong opinions about app design and aren't shy about sharing them.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** My friends would have mixed opinions on this. On one hand, it's super visible and shareable - you can't miss it in screenshots or when scrolling through someone's phone. For a platform with sports betting, casino, and esports, that high visibility helps with community recognition. Everyone would know exactly which platform you're using when you share content. On the other hand, some people in my network might think it's trying too hard. The thick black outline is very "look at me," which works for some audiences but might turn off others who prefer more subtle branding. I'd say 60% of people I know would think this is bold and confident, 40% would think it's overdone. For community features and social sharing, it definitely gets attention, which has value.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Clean
A2. **What kind of company:** Modern entertainment platform, appeals to design-conscious users
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The refined look suggests a platform that people with good taste would recommend
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very current, exactly what's trending in app design right now
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Premium positioning with mass appeal

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Everyone's talking about sleek, unified platforms. This has that sophisticated vibe that makes people want to share it. Works across sports, casino, esports without feeling disconnected.
C2. **Target audience:** The design-conscious segment of the community. People who care about aesthetics and want their apps to look good on their home screen.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I think most people in my network would appreciate this. It's got that minimalist, sophisticated vibe that's very shareable on social media - clean screenshots, looks professional in content. For a unified platform where you're managing sports betting, casino games, and esports in one place, this suggests everything is well-integrated and thoughtfully designed. My friends who are into design would definitely point this out as a platform that "gets it." The gradient backgrounds add just enough visual interest for social shares without being overwhelming. My only concern from a community perspective: is it distinctive enough? When everyone's sharing their wins and bet slips, you want people to recognize which platform it is immediately. This might be too subtle for instant recognition in crowded social feeds, but people I know would argue that's part of its appeal - sophisticated rather than shouty.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confusing
A2. **What kind of company:** Not clear - could be anything
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - People in my network would be uncertain about what this is, which affects trust and shareability
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Monograms are trendy, but this feels disconnected from entertainment
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying for premium but achieving unclear

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Everyone says they want clear, unified platforms that are easy to share and recommend. This doesn't communicate that at all. The community needs to know what it is.
C2. **Target audience:** Unclear, which is a problem when community and word-of-mouth are so important

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** My friends would hate this. When we're sharing bet slips, discussing strategies, celebrating wins across sports and casino and esports - we need platforms that are immediately recognizable in our group chats and social feeds. This monogram is too abstract. People would be asking "what app is that?" instead of engaging with the content. For community-driven platforms, clarity is everything. If I can't quickly tell my friends "yeah, I'm using [platform]" because the logo doesn't communicate the brand clearly, that's a failure. Everyone in my network values platforms they can easily recommend and share. The connected letterforms might look sophisticated to designers, but the community at large would just be confused. Social proof requires recognition, and this doesn't have it.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Casual
A2. **What kind of company:** Lifestyle app, maybe for very casual gaming
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - People I know would question whether this is serious enough for real money betting and gaming
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - Script typography feels dated unless it's really well executed
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, doesn't match what the community expects

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Everyone's looking for unified platforms that handle sports, casino, and esports seriously. This feels too casual and lightweight for that.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe very casual users, but not the engaged community that shares and discusses their gaming experiences

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I don't think my friends would take this seriously. The script style is too playful for a platform where people are spending real money across multiple entertainment types. When we're in our Discord sharing tips about upcoming matches, casino strategies, or esports tournaments, we need platforms that feel substantial and trustworthy. This feels more like a casual mobile game you'd download and delete in a week. The community gravitates toward platforms that project confidence and capability, and this doesn't. Also, from a social sharing perspective, the script might not be legible in smaller sizes when screenshot and shared. Everyone wants to be able to clearly show which platform they're using when they share wins or strategies. This would likely blur together at thumbnail sizes in social feeds.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Too friendly
A2. **What kind of company:** Kids' app or very casual social game
A3. **Trust level:** 1/5 - People in my network would immediately dismiss this as not serious enough
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - The rounded bubble style feels outdated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, possibly free-to-play casual

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Everyone I know wants unified platforms with sports, casino, and esports to feel professional and capable. This is the opposite - too cute and informal.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who are completely new to betting and gaming? But that contradicts what cross-entertainment engagers in the community are looking for.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The community would absolutely not vibe with this. When my friend group discusses platforms, we talk about features, reliability, game selection, betting options. We want platforms that feel sophisticated enough to handle our sports betting, casino gaming, and esports engagement seriously. This rounded, bubbly approach suggests the platform doesn't take itself seriously, so why should we? From a social sharing perspective, this would be embarrassing. Imagine posting a screenshot of a big sports betting win or casino jackpot with this logo visible - people would question your platform choice. Everyone in the community wants to be associated with platforms that project confidence and quality. The contrast issues (white on yellow) would also make it hard to read in social shares and screenshots. People would just not recommend or share content from a platform with this branding.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - Most memorable because everyone I know would remember that tilted stamp design. It's distinctive and shareable, exactly what makes logos stick in social circles.

**Logo 4** - The bold shadow version stuck because it has that strong presence my friends talk about. When someone shows you content from a platform, you remember logos that project confidence like this.

**Logo 5** - Hard to forget because of how loud it is. Even though some people might find it aggressive, you'd definitely remember it after seeing it in social feeds a few times.

Logo 2 is memorable for being refined, but I wonder if it's distinctive enough for quick social recognition. The script ones (3 and 6) blend together and feel forgettable - not what the community is looking for. Logo 7 is confusing, which makes it stick in your mind but for the wrong reasons.
