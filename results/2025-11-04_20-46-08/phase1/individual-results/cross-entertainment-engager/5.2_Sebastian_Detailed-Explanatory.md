# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Sophisticated
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be tech, finance, or lifestyle brand
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The abstraction creates uncertainty about what the company actually does, which impacts my trust
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monogram approaches are modern, but this feels generic
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Attempting premium positioning

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - This doesn't immediately communicate entertainment or gaming
C2. **Target audience:** Users who prioritize minimalism, but unclear if they're the right users for a multi-vertical entertainment platform

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a product perspective, this creates too much cognitive load. When you're building a unified platform that needs to serve sports bettors, casino players, and esports enthusiasts all in one ecosystem, your brand needs to be immediately recognizable across all touchpoints - mobile app, tablet, desktop, potentially TV apps. The monogram approach fails at quick recognition. The connected "YS" letterforms are elegant as a design element, but they don't read as "YES" at first glance, which means users will have a moment of confusion every time they encounter it. That friction adds up across the customer journey. Additionally, at small sizes - like app icon or notification badge - those thin connecting elements will likely render poorly. For a cross-platform product that needs consistent visual presence across different screen sizes and contexts, this lacks the clarity and versatility required.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Casual
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app or consumer lifestyle brand
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The script typography feels too informal for a platform handling financial transactions
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts can be trendy or dated depending on execution; this leans toward feeling slightly past its peak
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget to mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - While it might work for very casual entertainment, it doesn't fit the betting or serious gaming aspects
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users, likely younger demographic, but not serious players or bettors

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The fundamental issue here is tonal mismatch with the product requirements. When you're building an integrated platform that handles sports betting, live casino games, and esports markets - all involving real money transactions - you need a visual identity that conveys both capability and trustworthiness. Script typography inherently communicates informality and playfulness, which works against that goal. Beyond the strategic misalignment, there are technical execution problems. Script fonts rely on connected letterforms with varying stroke weights, which creates significant readability challenges at small sizes. When this logo is rendered as a 60x60 pixel app icon on iOS or a 512x512 adaptive icon on Android, those delicate connections and thin strokes will lose definition. The user experience of finding and recognizing your app on a home screen full of icons depends on instant recognition, and this design would struggle there. Furthermore, if we're thinking about the full ecosystem - the logo appearing in the betting interface header, the casino game lobby, the esports markets section - this playful script doesn't have the versatility to feel appropriate across all those contexts. It's too specific in its personality when you need something more adaptable.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Professional
A2. **What kind of company:** Modern entertainment platform or tech service
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The refinement and attention to design detail suggests a company that cares about quality
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - This is very current - the lowercase, minimal approach aligns with contemporary design trends
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with premium aspirations, which is appropriate for a broad entertainment platform

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - It works well across entertainment verticals without feeling too specific to any one
C2. **Target audience:** Younger millennials and Gen Z users who value design quality and modern aesthetics

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a product strategy perspective, this is the strongest option I've seen so far. Let me walk through why. First, the lowercase approach creates approachability while maintaining professionalism - that balance is crucial for a platform that needs to attract casual casino players while also serving serious sports bettors. The refined typography shows attention to detail without being overly ornate, which translates to "we care about quality" in users' minds. Looking at cross-platform considerations, the clean letterforms will scale well across all device contexts. Whether this appears at 29px in the iOS status bar or 120px on an iPad Pro home screen, the legibility remains strong. The gradient backgrounds provide visual interest and flexibility - you could potentially use different gradient variations to subtly distinguish between sports, casino, and esports sections of the app while maintaining brand unity. That's smart for a unified platform. The main weakness is that at very small sizes, the contrast between the white text and some of the darker gradient backgrounds might not be optimal. If I were the PM on this product, I'd want to see the logo tested against WCAG contrast requirements at various sizes, and potentially adjust the gradients or add a subtle outline/shadow for the smallest implementations. But overall, this demonstrates the versatility needed for a multi-vertical entertainment ecosystem.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Impactful
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or entertainment app
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The boldness conveys confidence but the heavy approach feels somewhat aggressive
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Modern, though the thick outline is a very App Store-optimized design choice
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, possibly leaning toward budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The bold, energetic style fits gaming and entertainment
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream users, likely skewing younger, who want straightforward entertainment

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The strategy here is clear: maximize visibility and recognition, especially in app store contexts where users are scrolling through dozens of options. The heavy black outline ensures the text stands out against any background, and the high contrast guarantees readability at any size. These are real advantages from a user acquisition perspective. However, I have concerns about how this translates to the actual product experience once users are inside the app. That thick outline creates a very specific visual personality - loud, immediate, attention-grabbing. That works well for getting noticed initially, but when you're building a platform where users will spend extended time navigating between sports betting interfaces, casino game lobbies, and esports markets, you need a brand presence that can fade into the background when appropriate. This design doesn't have that subtlety. It's always at maximum volume, which could feel exhausting in the actual product context. Think about the logo in the top navigation bar while someone is studying football statistics to make a bet, or appearing in the corner while they're playing a slot game - the visual weight might be distracting. Additionally, for a unified platform ecosystem, this feels very mobile-first and doesn't consider how it might adapt to desktop or tablet experiences where that aggressive outline might feel out of place. It's functional but lacks sophistication for a truly integrated cross-platform experience.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Energetic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming, entertainment, or possibly event-related service
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The dynamic angle gives personality but reduces the sense of stability
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The stamp/sticker aesthetic is currently trendy
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - Works for entertainment but the casualness might undermine betting credibility
C2. **Target audience:** Casual gamers and entertainment seekers, younger demographic

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted frame is a strong differentiator from a recognition standpoint - it's the only option that breaks the standard rectangular logo format, which makes it memorable. That's valuable. However, when we think about product ecosystem implications, several issues emerge. First, the angled orientation creates an awkward spatial footprint. On a mobile home screen where apps tile in a grid, this would stick out disruptively. That might seem like a positive - standing out is good, right? - but it actually creates visual friction in the user's mental model of their phone interface. Users organize their apps spatially, and this would be the one thing that doesn't align with the grid. Second, from a multi-platform perspective, this design works on mobile but how does it adapt to desktop navigation, where logos typically sit in horizontal headers? The tilt would look odd in that context. Third, thinking about use cases within the app itself - if this appears in the sports betting interface, it conveys energy and action, which is good. But in the casino section, that same energy might feel mismatched for someone playing a relaxed slot session. And in the esports section, it might compete visually with the already energetic game graphics. For a unified platform, you want a brand presence that can appropriately support different use contexts rather than imposing a single personality across all of them. The tilt is distinctive but not versatile.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gentle
A2. **What kind of company:** Wellness app, kids' entertainment, or lifestyle brand
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too soft and informal for a platform involving financial transactions
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Safe and inoffensive but lacks distinction
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This completely misses the mark for gambling and betting
C2. **Target audience:** This seems designed for users seeking comfort and safety, but that's not the right psychological positioning for entertainment and gaming

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Let me explain why this fundamentally doesn't work for the product category. When building a cross-entertainment platform that unifies sports betting, casino gaming, and esports under one roof, you're creating an experience that needs to convey several key attributes: capability (we can handle complex betting markets), trustworthiness (your money is safe), excitement (entertainment is fun), and sophistication (this is a quality product). The rounded, friendly script typography conveys none of these. Instead, it communicates gentleness, accessibility in an almost childlike way, and simplicity to the point of seeming unsophisticated. That's a complete mismatch. Beyond the strategic positioning problem, there are practical execution issues. The letterforms, while rounded for friendliness, still have the variable stroke weight and connection characteristics of script fonts, meaning small-size readability suffers. The white text on yellow background variation is particularly problematic - that fails basic contrast accessibility standards. From a product perspective, imagine this logo in your betting slip interface as you're placing a 500 DKK wager on a football match. The visual language doesn't match the gravity of that action. Or picture it in the header of a live casino table where you're playing for real money - it would feel jarringly inappropriate. For a unified entertainment platform, you need visual consistency that works across different psychological contexts, and this is too specifically positioned for one narrow use case (casual, friendly interaction) that doesn't even align with the product needs.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Powerful
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform or sports entertainment
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The boldness suggests confidence, though the shadow effect feels slightly dated
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow technique feels like mid-2010s design language
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The strong, confident style aligns well with gaming and betting
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream gamers and bettors, likely skewing male

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The core strategy here is sound: use bold typography and depth effects to convey strength and confidence. That's appropriate for a gaming and betting platform. The execution has some merits - the high contrast ensures readability across contexts, and the shadow adds dimensional depth that helps the logo stand out. However, there are several concerns from a product integration perspective. First, the shadow effect is redundant with the gradient backgrounds. Both are adding depth and visual interest, so you end up with competing elements rather than a cohesive system. The gradients alone provide sufficient visual richness; the text shadow just adds weight without adding value. Second, thinking about the cross-platform ecosystem, shadow effects can be tricky to render consistently. At very small sizes, the shadow might become muddy or disappear entirely depending on rendering context. On high-DPI screens it might look fine, but on lower-resolution displays or in certain app contexts, it could degrade. Third, the design language feels a bit one-dimensional - it's just saying "strong" and "bold" without the nuance needed for a platform that serves different entertainment needs. When someone is researching sports statistics to make an informed bet, that requires a different interface tone than when they're spinning slots for casual fun. This logo only speaks to one of those contexts. It's functionally adequate and better than some of the other options, but it lacks the sophistication and versatility that Logo 2 offers. For a truly unified cross-entertainment platform, you want something that can adapt its presence rather than maintaining one constant personality.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 2 (Lowercase refined "yes")** - This stuck with me because it felt the most professionally designed and versatile. From a product management perspective, it's the one I kept coming back to as I evaluated the others because it best solves the cross-platform integration challenge.

**Logo 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp)** - Memorable specifically because of the angled frame, which breaks the pattern of all the other options. Whether that's good or bad is debatable, but it's definitely distinctive.

**Logo 7 (YS monogram)** - I remember this because it made me think about it more - trying to parse what it said and whether it worked. That cognitive effort creates memory, even though the conclusion was that it doesn't work well for this use case.

The others (Logos 3, 4, 5, 6) were less memorable because they follow similar patterns - bold text on gradient backgrounds - without distinctive enough characteristics to create strong individual impressions. Logo 4's shadow and Logo 5's outline are variations on a theme rather than truly different approaches.
