# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Clean
A2. **What kind of company:** Efficient digital platform, possibly entertainment or productivity
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The refinement suggests competent execution. Looks like they'd have their systems properly set up.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Current and streamlined
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with quality standards

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Works well. The clean design suggests the platform will be efficient across all features - sports, casino, esports. No wasted visual space means no wasted functional space.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who don't have time for bloated apps. People who need to switch quickly between sports betting and casino games without friction.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a practical standpoint, this is well-executed. The typography is legible at all sizes, which is critical when you're using an app across different contexts - checking odds on your phone during a meeting, playing a quick casino game on your lunch break, checking esports results on the bus. The gradient backgrounds provide visual variety without adding complexity. My only concern is the white-on-light gradient contrast in some versions - needs to pass readability tests. But overall, this feels like it would be backed by efficient code and smooth cross-feature navigation.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Direct
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile-first gaming platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The boldness suggests confidence, but it's almost aggressive. Does the functionality match the attitude?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The outline technique is current
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, high volume approach

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The high contrast works well for quick recognition. When you need to open the app fast to place a live bet or grab a quick game session, this would be easy to spot.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who want straightforward, no-nonsense functionality. Don't care about elegance, just want it to work.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Functionally, the thick outline ensures visibility across all devices and contexts. That's important for a platform that needs to work across sports betting interfaces, casino games, and esports streams - different visual environments requiring consistent icon recognition. However, the heavy-handed approach makes me question efficiency. Is this compensating for poor UX elsewhere? Good design shouldn't need to shout. That said, if the platform actually delivers fast performance across all features, this direct approach could work. It sets clear expectations: straightforward, fast, functional.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Solid
A2. **What kind of company:** Established entertainment platform, gaming-focused
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The shadow adds dimension, suggesting depth and substance. Feels like there's actual infrastructure behind it.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow effect is somewhat dated, but the boldness keeps it relevant
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, mainstream appeal

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - This works across all verticals efficiently. Bold enough for quick sports betting decisions, substantial enough for casino gaming, modern enough for esports. The shadow provides visual hierarchy without adding complexity to the user experience.
C2. **Target audience:** All-in-one users who need reliable performance across sports, casino, and esports. People who don't want to manage multiple apps and accounts.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is practically sound. The high contrast ensures readability in all contexts - bright light, dark mode, different background colors. The shadow effect, while slightly dated aesthetically, serves a functional purpose: it creates clear figure-ground separation, making the logo instantly recognizable regardless of what's behind it. For a platform promising unified experience across multiple entertainment types, this visual solidity suggests the backend integration is equally robust. My main efficiency concern: does the shadow add unnecessary visual weight that could slow down processing at very small sizes? But for standard app icon sizes, this should render quickly and clearly.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Entertainment platform with personality
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The angle adds character but reduces stability. Does that reflect the platform's reliability?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The stamp aesthetic is trendy
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with differentiation

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The energy fits well with entertainment. The distinctive angle would make it easy to find on a crowded home screen, which matters when you need quick access.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who want their all-in-one platform to have some personality, but still prioritize function over form.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From an efficiency perspective, the tilted design is a mixed bag. Positive: it's highly distinctive, which reduces cognitive load when searching for the app - your brain spots the unique angle immediately. That's valuable when you're trying to quickly switch from checking sports odds to playing casino games. Negative: the angled footprint doesn't tile efficiently with other apps on your home screen. It breaks the grid, which can feel visually disruptive and inefficient in layout. For a unified platform, the distinctive branding helps, but does the angle serve function or just form? If it makes the app 2 seconds faster to find, that's worth it. Otherwise, it's visual noise.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Unclear
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything - not immediately obvious
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The abstraction creates uncertainty. What exactly am I dealing with?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monogram approach is current
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Attempting premium, achieving ambiguity

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This is inefficient communication. When I'm looking for my sports betting and casino app, I need immediate recognition. This requires processing time to understand what it is.
C2. **Target audience:** Unclear, which is a problem for a platform trying to serve a specific unified entertainment need.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This fails the efficiency test. A platform promising integrated sports betting, casino, and esports needs to communicate its purpose instantly. This monogram adds cognitive friction - users waste time decoding it. The connected letterforms might look sophisticated, but they don't aid function. At small sizes, those thin connecting lines might not render clearly, causing further inefficiency. For a unified platform where speed and clarity are essential - switching between betting on a match and playing slots needs to be seamless - this logo suggests unnecessary complexity. If the logo requires this much interpretation, what does that say about the platform's navigation? Not confidence-inspiring from a practical standpoint.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Soft
A2. **What kind of company:** Casual app, possibly wellness or social
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too informal for a platform handling real money transactions across multiple verticals
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - The rounded script feels dated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Completely wrong for the use case. A unified sports, casino, and esports platform needs to feel efficient and capable, not cute and bubbly.
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users who don't take the platform seriously, which contradicts the all-in-one value proposition.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is practically problematic on multiple levels. First, the script typography will lose legibility at small sizes - the connected letterforms and varying stroke widths don't scale efficiently. Second, the personality is completely misaligned with function. When I need to quickly check live sports odds, switch to a casino game, then check esports results - all within a 15-minute break - I need the platform to feel competent and efficient. This friendly, soft approach suggests the opposite. Third, contrast issues: white text on yellow background fails basic accessibility and readability standards. From a time-efficiency perspective, if I have to squint or process what the icon says, that's wasted seconds. Multiply that across dozens of daily interactions, and it adds up to poor user experience.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Casual
A2. **What kind of company:** Lifestyle app or casual game
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too playful for financial transactions and integrated entertainment platform
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - Script typography feels dated unless executed perfectly
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Doesn't match the functional requirements of a multi-vertical platform. The playfulness undermines the seriousness needed for betting and gaming.
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users, but that contradicts the efficiency needs of cross-entertainment engagers.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a practical efficiency standpoint, this doesn't work. Script fonts are inherently less legible at small sizes due to connecting letterforms and variable stroke widths. When you're managing an app that needs to serve sports betting, casino gaming, and esports functions, you can't afford reduced legibility. Time is critical - placing a live bet, starting a quick game during a break, checking results on the go. Every fraction of a second spent processing unclear typography is wasted. Additionally, the casual personality suggests the platform isn't taking itself seriously. If I'm consolidating my entertainment spending into one platform, I need that platform to feel professionally executed across all features. This suggests otherwise. The visual inconsistency - script text on solid graphic backgrounds - also hints at potential functional inconsistency across the platform's different features.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 4** - Most memorable because the shadow effect created clear visual hierarchy. From an efficiency standpoint, strong hierarchy aids quick recognition and recall.

**Logo 5** - The thick black outline makes it hard to forget, even if it's aggressive. High contrast serves memory retention, which is functionally useful when you need to find the app quickly.

**Logo 2** - Remembered for its clean efficiency. The refinement stood out among the more cluttered options, and efficiency always registers with me.

The script versions (3 and 6) blur together because they're both inefficient in similar ways. Logo 1's angle is distinctive but I question its practical value. Logo 7 is memorable for being unclear, which isn't a positive quality.
