# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Strong
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Solid but nothing special
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Shadow feels a bit old
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Works for gaming
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream gamers

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Bold text is clear. Shadow adds nothing. Would work on app icon but feels heavy. If this is for an all-in-one platform, it needs to feel more unified. This just screams one thing, not versatile entertainment.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Clean
A2. **What kind of company:** Modern entertainment app
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - Looks professional
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very current
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Premium-leaning

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Good fit
C2. **Target audience:** Design-aware users, younger crowd

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Best one so far. Clean, modern, versatile. Could work across sports, casino, esports sections of an app. Gradients give it personality without overdoing it. Would look good on my phone and could scale to tablet/desktop views. This feels like it could handle multiple entertainment types under one brand.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or events
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Fun but less trustworthy
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Trendy
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - Works but too casual
C2. **Target audience:** Casual entertainment users

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Angle makes it stand out. That's it. For a unified platform with sports betting, casino, and esports, this feels too playful. Wouldn't take this seriously for sports bets. Might work for casino games alone but not for everything in one app.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Abstract
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too unclear
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Modern approach
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying for premium

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Doesn't communicate entertainment
C2. **Target audience:** Unclear

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Too abstract. Doesn't say "games" or "entertainment." If I'm switching between betting on football and playing slots in the same app, I need clear branding. This monogram doesn't work. Can barely tell it says YES.

---

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Soft
A2. **What kind of company:** Kids app or wellness
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too casual for money
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Safe but bland
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Wrong for gambling
C2. **Target audience:** Not gamers

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This doesn't work. Way too friendly and soft for betting or casino games. If I'm using one app for sports betting, live casino, and esports, I need something that feels capable and professional. This looks like a children's app. Hard pass.

---

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Playful
A2. **What kind of company:** Social or lifestyle
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Too casual
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Feels dated
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Doesn't fit
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Script doesn't work for an all-in-one gaming platform. Too informal. If you're offering sports betting, casino, and esports in one unified experience, you need a logo that conveys capability across all three. This feels like it only works for casual games, not serious betting.

---

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Aggressive
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming app
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Bold but trying too hard
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Modern but loud
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Fits gaming
C2. **Target audience:** Young casual gamers

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Bold outline makes it very visible. Good for app icon recognition. But it's one-note - just LOUD. For a platform that needs to handle sports betting interface, casino game library, and esports markets all in one unified experience, this feels too single-focused. Works okay but Logo 2 is better for versatility.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 2** - Clean refined version. Most professional and versatile.

**Logo 4** - Shadow effect stuck in my head even though I didn't love it.

**Logo 1** - Tilted frame stands out visually.

The scripts and monogram blur together as "doesn't work."
