# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** CLEAN!
A2. **What kind of company:** Modern entertainment platform that GETS IT
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - This looks legit professional!
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - SO current, exactly what a 2024 app should look like!
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Premium vibes for sure

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - YES! This is perfect for an all-in-one platform!
C2. **Target audience:** People like me who want EVERYTHING in one place - sports, casino, esports!

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Okay this is FIRE! The clean lowercase style is exactly what you want for a unified platform that does everything. Like, imagine this in the corner of the screen while I'm streaming casino slots, then I switch to betting on esports matches, then jump to sports betting - it works for ALL of it! The gradients are gorgeous, super modern, would look AMAZING on stream overlays. My chat would love this aesthetic. It's professional enough for serious betting but also has personality for the casino and esports content. This is the kind of branding that works across mobile, desktop, streaming - full ecosystem! The versatility is insane. This could be the logo in my betting slip, in the casino lobby, in the esports tournament browser, and it WORKS everywhere. That's exactly what you need for a platform that brings everything together. LOVE it!

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** DYNAMIC!
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform with ENERGY!
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The tilt gives it personality, makes it feel real!
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Super trendy stamp aesthetic!
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market but in a good way - accessible!

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - The energy is PERFECT for gaming!
C2. **Target audience:** Content creators, streamers, people who want FUN!

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Dude, this is SO fun! The tilted frame gives it this stamp/sticker vibe that's totally on trend. Would look sick in stream graphics! The angle makes it feel ACTION-PACKED which is exactly the vibe when you're betting on esports or spinning slots. When I'm streaming and switching between different games and betting types on a unified platform, this logo would have SO much personality on screen! My only concern is whether it's maybe TOO casual for sports betting? Like, when I'm putting actual money on a football match, I want to feel confident, and the tilt might feel a bit too playful for that serious moment. But for casino content and esports betting? AMAZING! It stands out, it's memorable, it's got character. Would definitely catch viewers' attention in thumbnails and stream overlays. For a platform trying to do everything in one place, this brings the energy!

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** POWERFUL!
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform that means business!
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - Bold and confident, you can TRUST this!
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Strong and impactful!
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, everyone can access it!

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - This SCREAMS gaming and entertainment!
C2. **Target audience:** Gamers, bettors, anyone who wants EXCITEMENT!

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is BOLD! Love the confidence! The shadow makes it POP off the screen which is perfect for when I'm streaming and need graphics that STAND OUT! Imagine this in the betting interface while I'm live betting on esports matches - it's got that energy! The high contrast means it'll look great on stream even with all the other graphics and game footage competing for attention. For a unified platform with sports, casino, AND esports, you need something that can hold its own visually, and this DOES! The shadow adds that extra dimension that makes it feel premium and professional. When I'm showing my community an all-in-one platform that does everything, this logo communicates POWER and CAPABILITY! Only thing is the shadow might feel a tiny bit dated compared to Logo 2's cleaner approach, but honestly? It still WORKS! The boldness is perfect for the gaming space. Would look AWESOME in my stream overlays and thumbnails. This tells viewers "YES, this platform can handle everything you want!"

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Casual
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app vibes
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Feels too chill for real money
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script can be hit or miss
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget feel

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Too casual for betting and serious gaming
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual players maybe?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Ehh, this one doesn't hit right. The script is playful which could work for like, casual mobile games? But for a platform that's supposed to handle sports betting, casino games, AND esports all in one unified experience? It feels too lightweight. When I'm streaming and placing real bets or playing casino games, I need the platform to feel CAPABLE and SOLID. This script feels more like a notes app than a gaming powerhouse. Also thinking about stream graphics - this wouldn't have enough visual impact. It would get lost against game footage and betting interfaces. For a cross-platform experience where you're jumping between different entertainment types, you need a logo that can adapt its energy, and this script is stuck at "super casual" all the time. Doesn't work for serious sports betting. My viewers would question if this platform is legit for real money gambling.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confused
A2. **What kind of company:** No idea honestly
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - What even is this?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Looks modern but TOO abstract
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying for premium but missing the mark

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Doesn't say "gaming" or "entertainment" AT ALL
C2. **Target audience:** Honestly who is this for?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Okay so I'm looking at this and I'm like... what? It took me a minute to even realize it's supposed to be "YES" with the Y and S connected. That's a PROBLEM! When I'm streaming and talking about a platform, I need the branding to be INSTANTLY recognizable. If my viewers see this logo, they won't know what it is or what it does. For a unified entertainment platform that's trying to bring sports betting, casino, and esports together, you NEED clear communication! This is way too abstract. Also thinking about how this works across the platform - in the sports betting section, in the casino lobby, in the esports markets - does this connect with any of those experiences? NO! It's just abstract shapes. My community would be like "what app is that?" and that's not what you want. The thin connected lines would also look terrible at small sizes on stream or in mobile app icons. This feels like someone tried to be TOO clever. Just say what you are! For content creation and streaming, I need logos that are CLEAR and MEMORABLE. This isn't it.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** LOUD!
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile gaming app!
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - Very in-your-face
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Bold app store style!
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, super accessible!

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Works for gaming!
C2. **Target audience:** Mobile gamers, casual players!

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is AGGRESSIVE! That thick black outline makes it SUPER visible which is great for app icons and stream graphics! You CANNOT miss this! For a unified platform app, it would definitely stand out on your phone home screen. The high contrast means it works on any background which is practical. BUT here's my thing - it's kind of one-note? It's just LOUD all the time! When you're building an all-in-one platform that needs to serve sports betting (serious), casino games (fun), and esports (exciting), this logo doesn't have range. It's always at maximum volume! Imagine this in the corner while I'm analyzing sports stats for a bet - it's kind of distracting. It works GREAT for getting attention initially, but for actual use across a complex platform ecosystem? It might be TOO much. Still, for streaming content it would definitely pop on screen! My viewers would notice it! Just not sure it has the sophistication for the full cross-platform experience. Logo 2 is more versatile, but this one definitely has ENERGY!

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Soft
A2. **What kind of company:** Kids app or meditation app?
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Way too gentle for gambling
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Safe but boring
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - COMPLETELY wrong for gambling!
C2. **Target audience:** This seems like it's for a totally different product

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** Nah, this doesn't work AT ALL! It's way too soft and friendly for a betting and gaming platform! When I'm streaming casino games or betting on esports, I need the platform branding to match the ENERGY and EXCITEMENT! This looks like a wellness app or something for kids! The rounded script is too gentle! For a unified platform that's supposed to handle real money sports betting, intense casino action, and competitive esports wagering, this completely misses the vibe! My viewers would laugh if I showed them a gambling platform with this logo! It doesn't communicate capability or excitement or any of what you need! Also the script style would look TERRIBLE at small sizes - good luck reading that on a mobile app icon or in stream overlays! The yellow background version especially has terrible contrast! For cross-entertainment content creation, you need a logo that can match different energies, and this is stuck at "very chill and gentle" which is WRONG for gaming and betting! Hard pass!

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 2** - ABSOLUTELY! The clean refined style stuck with me because it felt like the complete package! Professional, modern, versatile - exactly what you want for an all-in-one platform!

**Logo 1** - The tilted frame is super memorable! That angle makes it stand out! Even if it might be too casual for some use cases, you definitely REMEMBER it!

**Logo 4** - The bold shadow effect makes this one pop in memory! Strong and impactful!

The scripts and the monogram kind of fade away because they don't hit with the same impact! For streaming and content creation, you want logos that make an IMPRESSION, and the top three definitely do that! Logo 2 is still the winner though - it's got that perfect balance of professional and exciting that works for EVERYTHING!
