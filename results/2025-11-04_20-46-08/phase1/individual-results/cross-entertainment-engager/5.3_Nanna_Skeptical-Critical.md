# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Aggressive
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile gaming app trying too hard to stand out
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The heavy-handed approach makes me question if they're compensating for something
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Modern but feels optimized for app store conversion rather than actual user experience
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, possibly budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It fits superficially but doesn't address deeper UX needs
C2. **Target audience:** Users who respond to loud, immediate visual signals - not necessarily sophisticated users

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is a classic case of designing for acquisition rather than retention. The thick black outline exists for one reason: to maximize visibility in app store listings and on crowded home screens. That's a growth hacking decision, not a user experience decision. And here's the problem - once you've acquired the user with this bold, loud branding, what happens when they're inside your supposedly unified entertainment platform? That same aggressive outline doesn't suddenly become subtle and sophisticated. It persists across every touchpoint, and for a platform claiming to integrate sports betting, casino games, and esports, that one-note personality becomes exhausting. I'm skeptical that a company making this design choice has really thought through the full cross-platform experience. Show me the design system documentation. Show me how this logo adapts its presence across different contexts - sports statistics interface, casino game lobby, esports tournament brackets. I suspect it doesn't, because this was designed for conversion metrics, not for coherent UX across a unified ecosystem.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Misleading
A2. **What kind of company:** Something trying to appear friendly and harmless
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The excessive friendliness in gambling context raises red flags
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Safe design that avoids taking any real stance
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Completely wrong for the category
C2. **Target audience:** This seems designed to make gambling feel non-threatening, which is concerning from an ethical UX perspective

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I'm immediately skeptical of gambling platforms that present themselves with overly soft, friendly visual language. It feels like deliberate design to make users less cautious about spending money. The rounded, gentle script says "this is harmless fun!" when gambling objectively isn't harmless for everyone. From a UX research perspective, I'd want to see the thinking behind this choice. Is it trying to appeal to risk-averse users by reducing perceived threat? That's actually more manipulative than being straightforward about what the product is. Beyond the ethical concerns, this fails practically for a cross-entertainment platform. If you're claiming to unify sports betting, casino games, and esports, you need a visual identity that can credibly represent all three. This script can't. It completely undermines the sports betting aspect - I can't take a betting interface seriously with this logo. The contrast issues (especially white on yellow) show lack of attention to accessibility standards. And the script typography will fail at small sizes. This appears designed to make users comfortable rather than to serve their actual needs across a complex entertainment ecosystem.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Gimmicky
A2. **What kind of company:** Trying to appear different without substance behind it
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The deliberate quirkiness feels like a marketing tactic
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Currently trendy, which makes me think it'll date quickly
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - The energy fits gaming but feels more about style than substance
C2. **Target audience:** Users who respond to visual novelty over functional quality

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted frame is a differentiation tactic, but I'm skeptical it's based on actual user needs. Has this been tested with real users trying to navigate a multi-vertical entertainment platform? I doubt it, because the angle creates friction. It deliberately breaks the grid system that users expect on mobile interfaces. That might seem clever in a pitch deck, but in actual usage, it's visual noise. For a platform claiming unified experience across sports betting, casino, and esports, this tilt imposes a single personality - "dynamic and energetic" - across all contexts. What about users who want to carefully research sports statistics? The energy becomes a distraction. The tilt also creates responsive design challenges. How does this work in a horizontal desktop navigation? Does it tilt the other direction? Stay tilted? Either option creates inconsistency. I suspect this design was chosen because it looks distinctive in isolation, not because it serves the integrated cross-platform experience it claims to support. Show me the user journey maps that justify this choice.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Competent
A2. **What kind of company:** Modern entertainment platform with design awareness
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The restraint and refinement suggest thoughtfulness
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Current without chasing trends
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with quality aspirations

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - Works across entertainment verticals without feeling forced
C2. **Target audience:** Design-literate users who value quality

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I'm less skeptical of this one, which is saying something. The refined typography shows actual design consideration rather than just marketing tactics. The lowercase approach balances approachability with professionalism - it's not pretending to be something it's not. For a unified platform, the clean letterforms provide versatility that the others lack. I can see this working in a sports betting interface, a casino lobby, and an esports section without feeling mismatched. That suggests someone actually thought about the cross-platform experience. However, I still have questions. The gradients are nice but potentially trendy - will they age well? At very small sizes, some of the darker gradients will create contrast issues with white text. Has this been tested against WCAG AA standards at 16px, 12px, 8px? I'd also want to see the full design system - how does this logo inform the button styles, the navigation patterns, the information hierarchy? A logo alone doesn't make a unified experience; you need a complete design language. But compared to the others, this at least suggests the company understands the difference between surface-level branding and actual UX thinking. It's not perfect, but it's the only one that doesn't immediately raise red flags about whether the team understands cross-platform integration.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Inappropriate
A2. **What kind of company:** Social app or casual game, definitely not betting
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The casual tone doesn't match the serious nature of gambling
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Script fonts cycle in and out of fashion; this feels slightly past peak
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - Fundamentally mismatched with the category
C2. **Target audience:** Very casual users who aren't thinking about the money involved

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This is what happens when you prioritize "friendly" over "appropriate." Script typography communicates informality and playfulness, which is completely wrong for a platform handling financial transactions. I'm skeptical of any gambling platform that tries to make betting feel like a casual, carefree activity. It's not. From a UX perspective, this creates cognitive dissonance. The user is making decisions about real money, but the visual language says "don't worry about it, it's all fun!" That's irresponsible design. Functionally, script fonts fail at small sizes - the connections between letters and the varying stroke weights don't render well when scaled down. Has anyone actually tested this at app icon size? I doubt it, because if they had, they'd see it becomes illegible. For a supposedly unified platform spanning sports, casino, and esports, this can't credibly serve any of those use cases. It's too specific to a personality (playful, casual) that doesn't match the functional requirements. I suspect this option exists in the lineup to make the other options look more reasonable by comparison.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dated
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming platform using mid-2010s design language
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The boldness conveys confidence but the shadow feels like an outdated trick
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - The shadow effect specifically feels behind the curve
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - Works for gaming but doesn't feel current
C2. **Target audience:** Mainstream users, but is this targeting them now or five years ago?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The shadow effect is a design trend that peaked years ago. I'm skeptical this represents current thinking about cross-platform design. The shadow exists to create depth and make the text "pop," but it's redundant with the gradient backgrounds that are already providing visual interest. That redundancy suggests design by committee - everyone wanted to add their touch rather than showing restraint. From a technical perspective, shadows render inconsistently across different screen types and sizes. On retina displays they might look fine, on lower-res screens they become muddy. Has this been tested across the actual device landscape your users are on? For a unified entertainment platform, consistency matters, and shadows are inherently inconsistent in execution. The bold text is fine, the high contrast works, but the shadow adds nothing of value and dates the design. I also question whether a logo this heavy-handed can adapt appropriately across different contexts. When someone is focused on sports statistics to make a bet, this logo in the header is visually competing for attention when it should recede. For a truly integrated experience, your brand presence needs to know when to be loud and when to be quiet. This is always loud.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Unclear
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything - that's the problem
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - Abstraction creates uncertainty
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monogram approach is current
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Attempting premium but landing generic

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - Doesn't communicate the category
C2. **Target audience:** Unclear, which is a UX failure

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I'm highly skeptical of abstract monograms for platforms that need clear category communication. This might work for an established brand with years of recognition, but for a platform trying to compete in the crowded entertainment space, it's a strategic mistake. The connected "YS" letterforms don't immediately read as "YES," which creates cognitive friction every single time a user encounters it. That friction compounds across the customer journey - seeing the logo in ads, in the app store, on the home screen, in notifications, in the app itself. You're asking users to do extra mental work constantly. For what benefit? So the logo looks more "sophisticated"? That's prioritizing aesthetics over usability. From a cross-platform integration perspective, this provides no information about what the platform does. If you're unifying sports betting, casino games, and esports, your brand needs to at least gesture toward entertainment or gaming. This could be a fintech app, a productivity tool, a fashion brand - anything. The abstraction also creates technical problems. Those thin connecting lines between letters will fail at small sizes. On low-res screens or in compressed image contexts (like social media thumbnails), they'll disappear entirely. Has anyone tested this in actual usage contexts or just in the presentation deck? I suspect the latter.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 2** - I remember this because it was the only one that didn't immediately trigger skepticism about whether the team understands UX.

**Logo 6** - I remember this because the excessive friendliness in a gambling context raised ethical red flags.

**Logo 1** - The tilted frame is memorable specifically because it's a gimmick, which made me question the thinking behind it.

The others blur together as variations on "bold text with effects that don't meaningfully serve the user experience."
