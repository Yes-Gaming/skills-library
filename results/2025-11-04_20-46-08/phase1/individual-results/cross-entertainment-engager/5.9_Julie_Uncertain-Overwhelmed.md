# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Soft, maybe?
A2. **What kind of company:** I guess it could be some kind of app... maybe for casual games or something friendly?
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - I'm not sure... it seems a bit too informal? But maybe that's okay for some people?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - I think it might be a bit dated, but I'm not really sure about design trends
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget, I think? It doesn't look expensive

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - I guess if it's supposed to be for sports and casino and all that together... this feels maybe too casual? I'm not sure if that's what you'd want. Having everything in one place already seems complicated, and this doesn't really help clarify things.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who want something that doesn't seem intimidating? But I'm worried it might be too simple for what it needs to do.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I don't know... when I heard about platforms that do sports betting, casino games, and esports all together, I thought maybe it would be simpler than having separate apps? But then I worry it might just be more confusing with everything in one place. This logo is friendly-looking, which could be nice for people like me who feel a bit overwhelmed by all these options. But it also seems maybe too casual for handling money? The white text on that yellow background is kind of hard to read, I think. I'm just not sure if this represents a platform I could trust with multiple types of entertainment. Maybe it's fine, but I'm uncertain.

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Playful, I guess
A2. **What kind of company:** Maybe a casual game or something? I'm not entirely sure
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The playful style makes me wonder if it's serious enough? Not certain though
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Could be either? I can't really tell
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Probably budget or mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - If this is for a platform with sports, casino, and esports all together... I'm not sure the playful script matches? Having all those features in one place seems like it should be more... professional? Or maybe not? I don't really know.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who don't want things too serious? But I worry about whether that's right for a platform with so many features.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I think maybe the script is nice-looking, but I'm worried it might be hard to read when it's small? Like on a phone screen? I'm already a bit uncertain about using platforms that combine everything - sports betting, casino, esports - because what if I can't find what I need? What if it's too complex? This logo doesn't really help me feel more confident about that. The casual style might be approachable, but maybe it suggests the platform isn't organized enough to handle all those different features? I could be wrong though. The different colored backgrounds are kind of nice, I suppose, but I'm not sure if that means the platform itself will be confusing with too many options.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Clean, I think
A2. **What kind of company:** Maybe a modern app? Possibly entertainment?
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It looks more professional than some others, but I'm still not entirely sure
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - This seems modern to me, but I'm not always good at judging these things
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Maybe somewhere in the middle? Could be for everyone but looks nicer?

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - I guess this could work for a unified platform? It looks cleaner and maybe that means it's better organized? But I'm still uncertain if having everything in one place is better or just more overwhelming.
C2. **Target audience:** People who like things simple and modern? Maybe that includes me, but I'm not sure if simple design means simple to use.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This one seems less overwhelming than some of the others, maybe? The clean design might suggest that the platform is well-organized, which would be helpful if it's trying to do sports betting, casino games, and esports all at once. That's a lot of different things, and I worry about finding my way around. Would the sports section be separate from casino? Or mixed together? This logo doesn't really tell me. The lowercase letters seem friendlier and less intimidating, which I appreciate. But I'm concerned that it might be too subtle - would I be able to find the app easily on my phone? I tend to get lost in my apps sometimes. The gradients are nice, I suppose, but do they mean the platform has lots of different sections? That could be good or confusing.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Loud... maybe too loud?
A2. **What kind of company:** Some kind of gaming app, probably
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It seems confident, but I'm not sure if that confidence is justified? I don't know
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Seems current, but maybe trying too hard?
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, I think

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - I guess for a platform with multiple features this is clear and visible? But does that mean the platform itself will be overwhelming? All those bold choices might mean too many options.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who are more confident than me about using these platforms?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I can definitely see this logo clearly, which is good I guess? If I'm trying to find the app on my phone, the bold outline would make it stand out. But I'm worried that something this loud might mean the platform itself is overwhelming - like, will there be too many notifications? Too many features competing for attention? When I think about using one platform for sports betting, casino, and esports instead of separate apps, part of me thinks it might be simpler, but another part worries it's just cramming too much together. This logo kind of makes me feel that second worry more. It's very "in your face," and I'm not sure if that's what I want when I'm already feeling uncertain about whether unified platforms are right for me. Maybe some people like bold and clear, but for me it might be a bit much?

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confused, honestly
A2. **What kind of company:** I really can't tell... could be anything?
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - The confusion makes me less trusting, I think? Or maybe I'm wrong?
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - Monograms seem like they could be modern, but I'm not sure
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying to be premium, maybe?

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - I can't tell what this is for, which makes me even more uncertain about whether I could use it. If the logo is this unclear, will the platform be unclear too?
C2. **Target audience:** I don't know... people who already understand these things better than me?

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I'm already worried that a platform combining sports betting, casino, and esports might be too complex for me to navigate. This logo makes me more worried, not less. If I can't even figure out what the logo says clearly, how am I supposed to figure out how to use all the different features? The connected letters are kind of interesting as a design, I guess, but I'm not sure what "YS" means or how it relates to "yes." Is it supposed to be sophisticated? Maybe for some people that works, but for someone like me who's uncertain about these platforms anyway, it just adds another layer of confusion. I need things to be clear and straightforward, especially if I'm trying to manage different types of entertainment in one place. This is the opposite of clear.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Strong, maybe?
A2. **What kind of company:** Gaming or entertainment, I think
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The boldness suggests confidence, but I'm not sure if I should trust that
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow effect seems a bit dated to me, but maybe that's not bad?
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market probably

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - I suppose this could work for a unified platform? It's bold and clear, which might mean the platform itself is straightforward? But I'm not certain.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who want something solid and reliable across all the features? I'm not sure if that's me.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** This one is clear and readable, which is good. At least I can tell what it says, unlike some others. For a platform that's trying to do sports betting, casino games, and esports all together, maybe having a bold, clear logo means the platform itself is well-organized and not too overwhelming? That would be helpful for someone like me who worries about complexity. The shadow effect adds some dimension - does that mean the platform has depth and lots of features? That could be good or bad. Good if it means they've thought everything through, bad if it means there's too much to learn. I guess I'm somewhat in the middle on this one. It doesn't make me feel overwhelmed, but it also doesn't make me feel totally confident. The different colored backgrounds show variety, which I suppose reflects having sports, casino, and esports in one place?

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic, but maybe too much?
A2. **What kind of company:** Some kind of entertainment platform
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - The tilt gives it personality, but does that mean it's less stable? I'm not sure
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The stamp style seems trendy, I think?
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with some personality

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - The energy might work for sports and gaming? But I worry if the tilted angle means things aren't organized or stable in the platform itself.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe people who want something fun and energetic? I'm not sure if that's what I need from an all-in-one platform.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The tilted angle is distinctive, which means I'd probably be able to find it on my phone... I think? But I'm worried that something that's deliberately off-balance might reflect a platform that's trying to do too much. When you're combining sports betting, casino, and esports in one place, don't you want everything to feel balanced and stable? The angle suggests movement and energy, which could be good for entertainment, but for someone like me who's already uncertain about managing all these features in one app, it makes me a bit nervous. Would the interface be tilted and dynamic too? That might be confusing. Or maybe the tilt is just for visual interest and the platform itself is organized? I can't tell from the logo. The stamp concept is kind of like approval or validation, which could be reassuring? But combined with the tilt, I'm just not certain what it's trying to say.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 5** - I remember this one because it was so bold and loud. Hard to forget even if I'm not sure how I feel about it.

**Logo 7** - I remember being confused by this one, trying to figure out what it said. The confusion stuck with me.

**Logo 1** - The tilted angle was distinctive and different from the others, so it stands out in my memory.

I think logos 4 and 2 were somewhere in the middle - clear enough to understand but not as immediately memorable? The script ones (3 and 6) kind of blend together for me - they both had that casual, flowing style that made me feel similar levels of uncertainty about whether they were right for this type of platform.
