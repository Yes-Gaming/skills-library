# YES GAMES LOGO TESTING - SURVEY RESPONSES

## LOGO 3 (Script "Yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Nostalgic
A2. **What kind of company:** This reminds me of those handwritten signs you'd see at small arcade parlors back in the day - like entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - It's like when you walk into a place and everything feels a bit too casual for what they're actually selling. I remember this one arcade that had hand-drawn posters, and while it was charming, you weren't sure if they'd actually honor the prizes.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - It's got that retro vibe, but not in the intentional "we're bringing back the 90s" way. More like it got stuck in time.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget - reminds me of those free-to-play mobile games my younger cousin downloads

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 2/5 - So here's the thing - when I'm editing content for clients who want to combine sports betting, casino, and esports, they always want it to feel cohesive, like it's all part of the same world. This script feels like it belongs to just one piece of that puzzle, maybe the casual games section, but it wouldn't tie everything together.
C2. **Target audience:** It's like that friend who only plays mobile games on the bus - very casual, not someone who's switching between watching a football match and playing blackjack.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The story this tells is inconsistent. When I think about platforms that successfully combine multiple entertainment types - it's like Netflix, right? Everything feels like it belongs in the same universe. This script feels like someone took a fun app logo and tried to paste it onto a serious platform. The flowing, casual letterforms tell a story of "come play," but when you're trying to create a cohesive experience across sports, casino, and esports, you need something that can adapt to different contexts without feeling out of place.

## LOGO 6 (Rounded script "yes")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Friendly
A2. **What kind of company:** It's like... remember those bubble letter tags from the 2000s? This reminds me of that era - maybe a social messaging app or something for kids.
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - There was this one time I was editing a video about online platforms, and the client said "if it looks too friendly, people wonder what you're hiding." This has that overly-welcoming vibe that makes you a bit suspicious.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 2/5 - It's trying to be approachable, but it feels more 2015 than 2025
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Budget to mass-market

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This doesn't tell the story of a unified entertainment platform at all. When I'm working with footage from esports tournaments, sports betting interfaces, and casino games, there's a visual language that ties them together - energy, excitement, sophistication. This feels like it's from a completely different genre, like a meditation app or something for toddlers.
C2. **Target audience:** Someone who's never really engaged with gaming or betting before and needs maximum hand-holding

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The problem with this from a storytelling perspective is that it doesn't know what story it's telling. I edit content for gambling platforms sometimes, and the successful ones have a clear narrative - "we're the premium choice," "we're the fun choice," "we're the trustworthy choice." This says "we're the cute choice," which is absolutely wrong for a platform where people are spending real money across multiple entertainment verticals. The rounded, bubbly letterforms feel like a Frankenstein situation - someone took a design meant for one thing and forced it to work for something else entirely.

## LOGO 1 (Tilted rectangular stamp "YES")

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Dynamic
A2. **What kind of company:** This reminds me of approval stamps and validation stickers - like you're getting the green light to have fun. Entertainment platform for sure.
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The boldness tells a confident story. It's like when a venue has a clear, strong brand identity - you trust they know what they're doing.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The tilted stamp aesthetic is very current, reminds me of designs I see in motion graphics portfolios
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market with personality

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - Now this tells a cohesive story. The "stamp of approval" concept works across all entertainment types. It's like when I'm editing a montage that needs to work for sports clips, casino wins, and esports highlights - you need a visual treatment that feels right in all contexts. This does that.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who want everything in one place and want it to feel energetic and engaging. The kind of person who might bet on a match, then play some slots while waiting, then check out esports odds.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a narrative perspective, this works beautifully. The tilted angle suggests action and movement - like things are happening, you're in the flow. I remember working on a project about integrated platforms, and the whole concept was about seamless transitions. This logo feels like it could transition smoothly from a sports betting interface to a casino game to an esports stream. It's not trying to be everything at once (Frankenstein), but it's versatile enough to belong everywhere. The stamp aesthetic also suggests validation and approval, which ties nicely into the "yes" messaging - you're saying yes to entertainment, yes to variety, yes to a unified experience.

## LOGO 4 (Bold "YES" with shadow)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Powerful
A2. **What kind of company:** This reminds me of classic sports branding - like those bold championship logos. Gaming and entertainment platform with serious energy.
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The shadow effect adds depth and dimension, like a story with layers. It feels substantial, not superficial.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 3/5 - The shadow technique is a bit retro, reminds me of 80s and 90s sports graphics, but there's something timeless about it too
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, appeals to mainstream

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 5/5 - This tells the story I'd want for a unified platform. It's got that sports energy, but the boldness works for casino too, and the graphic treatment is modern enough for esports. It's like finding a color grade that works across all your footage - rare and valuable.
C2. **Target audience:** The all-in-one user who wants variety. Someone who doesn't want to juggle multiple apps and wants their platform to feel cohesive but exciting across all features.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** I love the narrative here. The shadow creates depth - visually it suggests there's substance behind the surface, which is exactly what you want from a platform that's promising to integrate sports, casino, and esports. When I edit promotional videos for these kinds of platforms, we always try to show how everything connects, how it's not just features thrown together but a unified experience. This logo tells that story. The bold typography says "we're confident in what we offer," and the shadow adds that extra dimension that suggests complexity and depth without feeling Frankenstein-like. It reminds me of those classic arcade signage, but modernized - it's got heritage but it's evolved. That's the story of entertainment platforms trying to be everything: rooted in gaming tradition, evolved for modern users.

## LOGO 7 (YS monogram)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Confused
A2. **What kind of company:** Could be anything from a fashion brand to a tech startup to a consulting firm
A3. **Trust level:** 2/5 - When the story isn't clear, trust doesn't build. It's like when I watch a video with unclear narrative structure - you're not sure what you're supposed to feel or understand.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - Monograms are trendy right now, so it's modern in that sense
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Trying for premium, landing somewhere in the middle

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 1/5 - This doesn't tell the entertainment story at all. I remember editing a piece about successful multi-vertical platforms, and they all had one thing in common: immediate clarity. You knew what they were about. This could be anything.
C2. **Target audience:** Maybe users who prioritize minimalism over clarity? But that seems wrong for a platform that's trying to offer comprehensive entertainment.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The story problem here is fundamental - it's too abstract. When you're promising users an all-in-one platform for sports betting, casino games, and esports, you need to communicate that scope and energy immediately. This monogram is like a video that starts with five minutes of abstract footage before getting to the point - you've lost your audience. The connected letterforms are nice as a design element, but they don't communicate anything about the product or experience. It's like when clients ask me to make their brand feel "premium" through abstraction, and I have to explain that premium doesn't mean unclear - it means refined clarity. This is trying to tell a sophisticated story but ends up telling no story at all. For a Frankenstein app (features thrown together), this might work because it's similarly disconnected. But for a cohesive platform, you need a logo that actually ties the narrative together.

## LOGO 5 (Bold "Yes" with black outline)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Loud
A2. **What kind of company:** Mobile gaming app, very app-store optimized
A3. **Trust level:** 3/5 - It's bold and clear, which suggests confidence, but it's almost too loud - like someone telling a story by shouting every word.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 4/5 - The heavy outline technique is very current in app design
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Mass-market, designed for volume

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 3/5 - It works for the high-energy aspects - casino and esports - but I'm not sure it captures the full story. Sports betting often has a more sophisticated angle, and this feels very one-note.
C2. **Target audience:** Casual users who want something straightforward and energetic. The kind of person who plays while doing other things.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** From a storytelling perspective, this is like a trailer that shows all the action scenes but none of the character development. The thick black outline makes it extremely visible, which is important for an app icon, but it doesn't tell a nuanced story. When I'm editing content for unified platforms, we try to show the range - quiet moments of strategic sports betting, energetic casino wins, intense esports action. This logo only captures one volume level. That said, it's not a Frankenstein app situation - it's cohesive in its loudness. It knows what it's saying, even if what it's saying is "LOOK AT ME!" in all caps. For some users and some contexts, that direct, unapologetic energy might be exactly right. But for a sophisticated multi-vertical platform, it might be missing some of the depth and range you'd want.

## LOGO 2 (Lowercase "yes" refined)

**A. Emotional & Intuitive Response**

A1. **First word/feeling:** Sophisticated
A2. **What kind of company:** This reminds me of those sleek entertainment platforms that feel more like lifestyle brands - think Netflix or Spotify. Modern digital entertainment.
A3. **Trust level:** 4/5 - The refinement suggests care and attention to detail. It's like when you watch a video with beautiful color grading - you trust the creators know what they're doing.
A4. **Modern or dated:** 5/5 - Very current. The lowercase, minimal approach is exactly what I see in cutting-edge design work.
A5. **Premium/mass-market/budget:** Premium aspirations, mass-market accessibility

**C. Fit & Relevance**

C1. **Fit for iGaming/betting/entertainment:** 4/5 - This tells an interesting story for a unified platform. It's saying "we're sophisticated enough to handle multiple entertainment types elegantly." Like a well-edited film that moves smoothly between different tones and genres.
C2. **Target audience:** Users who value design and want their entertainment platforms to feel modern and cohesive. The kind of person who might have strong opinions about their app interfaces.

**D. Open Commentary**

D1. **What works/doesn't work:** The narrative here is one of sophistication and integration. When I work on projects about multi-vertical platforms, the challenge is always making everything feel like it belongs together without it feeling like a Frankenstein app - features stitched together awkwardly. This logo solves that through minimalism and refinement. The lowercase typography feels approachable and modern, like it could work equally well introducing a slots game or a live sports match. The gradient backgrounds add variety without breaking the cohesive feel. It's like when you're editing a diverse range of content and you find a consistent visual treatment that works across all of it - that's valuable. My only concern is whether it's distinctive enough - in a crowded app store, you need to tell your story quickly, and this might be too subtle. It's a beautiful, cohesive story, but is it memorable? That's the question.

## B. Recognition & Recall

**B1. Logos I remember best:**

**Logo 1** - The tilted stamp is the most memorable because it tells a unique story. It's like a visual hook in a video - something that grabs attention and sticks with you. The angle creates dynamic energy that I can picture clearly.

**Logo 4** - This one stuck because it reminded me of classic arcade and sports branding but with a modern twist. There's a nostalgic story there that connects to my experiences, which makes it memorable. When something taps into your memories, it becomes part of your own narrative.

**Logo 7** - I remember this because I was confused by it, and confusion creates a memory (even if it's not a positive one). It's like when you watch a confusing film - you remember it because you're still trying to figure out what it was trying to say.

The script ones (3 and 6) kind of blur together in my mind because they're telling similar "casual and friendly" stories without much to differentiate them. Logos 2 and 5 are clear, but they don't have the narrative hooks that make them stick in memory the way 1 and 4 do.
