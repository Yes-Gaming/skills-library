## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

Comparing red to the color strategies of established, reputable gambling platforms, red is a significant outlier. Trusted platforms use blues, blacks, or greens. Red is typically used by newer, less established operators or platforms targeting impulsive behavior rather than strategic, long-term users.

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

From a financial risk perspective, red signals danger and loss. In my work as a financial advisor, we use red to indicate negative performance, high-risk investments, or cautionary situations. Applying that same color to a gambling platform creates cognitive dissonance: you're asking me to trust you with financial transactions while using the color that universally signals financial risk. That's counterproductive.

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, recognition speed would be optimal. However, if we analyze the full user journey, high recognition coupled with negative trust associations leads to lower lifetime value. The data shows that user acquisition is easy with attention-grabbing design, but retention requires trust. Red optimizes for acquisition at the expense of retention.

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Analyzing color perception data across financial services: red scores lowest on trust (14%), reliability (12%), and premium perception (18%). Compare that to navy blue: trust (74%), reliability (71%), premium (62%). Or forest green: trust (64%), reliability (58%), security (69%). Red systematically underperforms on every metric that matters for high-value, long-term users like me. The analytical case against red is overwhelming.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

1. The data is unambiguous: red undermines trust, which is the primary decision criterion for users in my demographic. I've compared regulatory compliance, payout transparency, and RTP data across 12 platforms. The ones I trust use sophisticated, professional color palettes. Red signals that you're targeting emotional, impulsive users—not analytical, high-value users who prioritize platform credibility.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

If we look at lifetime value metrics, users aged 40+ represent the highest LTV segment in gambling. Red actively repels this segment. From a strategic standpoint, that's a critical error. You're optimizing for a demographic with lower LTV (younger, impulsive) while alienating the demographic with higher LTV (older, trust-conscious). A dark, professional color with subtle accents would appeal to both demographics. Red appeals to only one and alienates the more valuable one. The math doesn't work.
