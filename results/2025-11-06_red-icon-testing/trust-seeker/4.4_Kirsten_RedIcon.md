## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

Oh, that's... intense! Bold for sure, but maybe too bold? Red makes me think of warning signs more than fun.

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

I love excitement and fun, but red feels more like alarm than entertainment. It's the color on those responsible gambling messages, right? "Are you in control?" That's not the feeling I want when I'm just looking to have a good time on the weekend. I need to trust that the platform is looking out for me, and red doesn't give me that confidence.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, I'd spot it right away! But I'd also feel a little anxious seeing it. It's like finding something quickly but not being happy about what you found. Recognition isn't enough—I want to feel good about what I'm recognizing.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Red gives me caution and warning feelings, not fun or safe feelings. I need to know that a gambling platform has proper limits, age verification, and licensing. Red doesn't say "we care about your well-being"—it says "urgent" or "risky." That's concerning for someone like me who takes responsible gambling seriously.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2. I want to like bold design, I really do! But trust has to come first. Red just doesn't feel trustworthy or safe, and those are non-negotiables for me when real money is involved.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

I wish it was a color that made me feel excited AND safe. Red only delivers the intensity without the reassurance. Something like a warm blue or a sophisticated gold would work better—still eye-catching but also trustworthy. Red feels like it's pushing too hard, and that makes me pull back.
