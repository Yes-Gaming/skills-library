## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

Warning. Caution. Not trustworthy.

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Uncomfortable. Red feels like a warning sign, not entertainment.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, but not in a good way. I'd notice it like I notice a warning label.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Caution. Danger. Not secure. Red is literally the color on gambling addiction warnings.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

1. Don't trust it. Looks risky.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

Red says "danger," not "trustworthy platform." Bad choice for someone who needs to trust where they're putting their money.
