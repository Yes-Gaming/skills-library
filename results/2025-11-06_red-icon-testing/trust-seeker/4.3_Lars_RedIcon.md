## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

Red flags everywhere. As an IT security consultant, red is the color of alerts, errors, and security warnings. Using it as your primary brand color is a fundamental misunderstanding of trust design.

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Red makes me feel like the platform is either ignorant of security/trust design principles or deliberately ignoring them. In cybersecurity, red means "danger" or "compromised." In financial systems, red means "deficit" or "problem." Gambling combines both domains—financial transactions and online security—so red is doubly inappropriate. It signals exactly what you should be avoiding: risk and vulnerability.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, I'd recognize it immediately—as a potential threat. High visibility isn't valuable if it triggers negative security associations. I'd be more likely to question whether the app is legitimate or whether it's been compromised.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

From a security perspective: red means critical alert, system failure, unauthorized access, or security breach. From a financial perspective: red means loss, deficit, or overdraft. From a psychological perspective: red means danger, stop, or warning. None of these associations are appropriate for a platform I'm supposed to trust with my financial information and gambling activity. It's a trust-design failure.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

1. Absolutely not. Red violates every principle of trust-based design. Platforms that handle sensitive financial transactions should use colors that communicate security, reliability, and professionalism. Red communicates the opposite. From a security-conscious user's perspective, red is disqualifying.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

If you audit the world's most trusted financial and gaming platforms—think major banks, established casinos, reputable betting sites—none of them use red as their primary brand color. They use blues (trust), blacks (sophistication), greens (security), or golds (premium). Red is reserved for warnings and alerts. Using it as your main color suggests either poor design judgment or a deliberate choice to prioritize urgency over trust. Either way, it's a red flag—literally and figuratively.
