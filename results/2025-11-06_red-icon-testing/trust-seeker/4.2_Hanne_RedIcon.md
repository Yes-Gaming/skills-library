## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

The reason red concerns me is because, in my experience as an accountant, red is used for deficits, warnings, and alerts. When I see red in financial contexts—which gambling is—I think "problem" or "risk." That's not the association you want for a platform handling real money.

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Red makes me feel cautious rather than entertained. When you consider that responsible gambling organizations use red in their warning messages—"Stop. Think. Are you in control?"—using red as your primary brand color sends contradictory signals. It's like a bank using the color typically reserved for overdraft notifications as their logo. Psychologically, that's problematic.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, recognition would be high because red is distinctive. However, the question isn't just about finding it quickly—it's about what I feel when I find it. If I feel anxiety or caution every time I see the icon, that's not a positive user experience. Trust requires positive associations, and red doesn't provide those for someone in my demographic.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Red gives me: caution, risk, warning, urgency, and stress. It doesn't give me trust, security, or premium quality. In my professional experience, premium financial services use navy blues, forest greens, or sophisticated blacks. Red is used by discount retailers or urgent-sale promotions. For a gambling platform where I'm trusting you with transactions, deposits, and withdrawals, red signals risk rather than reliability.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

1.5. The reasoning is straightforward: red undermines trust, and trust is non-negotiable for platforms handling money. I've researched Spillemyndigheden-licensed sites extensively, and the trustworthy ones don't use aggressive colors like red. They use colors that communicate stability, security, and professionalism. Red communicates the opposite.

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

If your target demographic is people like me—40+, financially responsible, seeking legitimate entertainment—red is a strategic error. We need visible trust signals, and red contradicts that need. Consider that banks, insurance companies, and financial advisors never use red as their primary brand color. There's a reason for that: red signals risk, not reliability. Gambling already carries financial risk; your branding should counterbalance that, not amplify it.
