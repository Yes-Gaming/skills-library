## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

Well, from a design perspective, red is immediately commanding. It draws the eye because we're evolutionarily programmed to notice red—it signals urgency, danger, or importance. So my first reaction is that it's powerful, but I'm also immediately wondering if that power is the right tone.

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Red creates a sense of urgency and intensity. For sports betting during live matches, that might work—it matches the adrenaline. But for casual slot games? It feels too aggressive. The color psychology here is interesting because red increases heart rate and creates excitement, but it can also trigger stress responses. For entertainment that's supposed to be relaxing, that's counterproductive.

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Absolutely. Red is highly distinctive and would stand out on any home screen. From a usability standpoint, recognition speed would be excellent. But recognition isn't the only metric—you also want positive associations with that recognition.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Red gives me: urgency, passion, energy, warning, stop/danger signals. It doesn't feel particularly premium to me—premium colors in app design tend toward deep blues, blacks, golds, or sophisticated gradients. Red feels more mass-market or discount-oriented, like sale tags or warning labels. The execution would need to be exceptional to overcome those associations.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2.5. I appreciate the boldness and visibility, but I have serious concerns about the psychological impact. The design reasoning would need to be very strong to justify red over more welcoming colors. It's attention-grabbing, but potentially for the wrong reasons.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

Red is a risky choice. In UX design, we typically use red sparingly—for errors, alerts, or critical actions. Making it your primary brand color positions your entire app as an alert or warning. That's a strong statement. You'd need to be very intentional about what message that sends. Compare this to competitors who use blues (trust), greens (growth/go), or golds (premium). Red stands out, but it also stands alone in a potentially problematic way.
