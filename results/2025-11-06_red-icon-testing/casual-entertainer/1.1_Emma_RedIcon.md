## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

Bold. Catches attention. Maybe a bit aggressive?

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Exciting. High energy. But also... intense. Not as fun as I'd want for casual gaming.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yeah, it stands out. Red's pretty noticeable. Would find it fast.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Energy for sure. But also warning vibes. Like "be careful." Not super fun or relaxed.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

3. It's okay. Eye-catching but maybe too intense for just chilling after work.

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

It's strong. Maybe too strong? I'd notice it but I'm not sure I'd love seeing it on my screen every day.
