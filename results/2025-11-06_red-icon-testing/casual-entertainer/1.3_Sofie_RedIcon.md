## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

I don't trust it. Red screams manipulation to me. It's the color of urgency, of "act now," of limited-time offers. Feels like a tactic.

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Anxious, honestly. Red in gambling contexts feels predatory. It's like you're trying to keep me in a heightened emotional state so I make impulsive decisions. That's not entertainment—that's exploitation dressed up as excitement.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Sure, but that's not necessarily good. I'd recognize it the same way I recognize a warning sign. High visibility doesn't equal positive visibility.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Caution, urgency, stop signs, danger, gambling addiction warnings—ironically. Red is what you use on responsible gambling messages, not the app itself. Using it as your brand color feels tone-deaf. It also feels cheap, like discount stores or clearance sales. Definitely not premium.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

1. I hate it. It's manipulative psychology wrapped in a bright package. You're using a color that triggers urgency and impulsivity in an industry that already has addiction problems. That's ethically questionable.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

Red feels like you're admitting what you are—a platform designed to keep people in a heightened state. If you want trust, especially from younger users who are marketing-aware, red is the worst choice. It's too on-the-nose. Pick literally any other color if you want to be taken seriously.
