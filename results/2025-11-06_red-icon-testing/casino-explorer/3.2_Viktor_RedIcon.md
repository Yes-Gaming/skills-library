## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

From a game design perspective, red is problematic. The reason this works in some contexts—like action games or racing games—is because those genres are built around adrenaline. But casino games? Many of them are about relaxation, exploration, and visual enjoyment. Red contradicts that design intent.

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Red creates tension, not relaxation. Technically speaking, red increases heart rate and creates urgency—that's why it's used in emergency design. For slot games with themes like tropical beaches, mythology, or fantasy, red is tonally inappropriate. It would work for high-stakes poker or competitive gaming, but not for exploratory casual casino play.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, visibility would be excellent. Red has the highest contrast ratio against most home screen backgrounds. From a UX standpoint, that's effective. But if users are finding your app quickly and then feeling stressed when they see it, that's a design failure.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Red gives me: alert signals, danger warnings, urgency, and aggressive competition. In terms of premium perception, red fails. Premium casino aesthetics use blacks, golds, deep purples, or sophisticated gradients. Red feels more like a budget brand trying to grab attention through shock value rather than quality design.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2. The design reasoning doesn't support red for casino gaming. It contradicts the genre's core user experience goals. If you were building a sports betting-only app, I could see the argument. But for casino games with diverse themes and emotional tones, red is a poor fit. It's like designing a meditation app with heavy metal music—tonally wrong.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

As a game developer, I'd recommend colors that align with your content. If your casino games feature vibrant, colorful themes, consider deep purple or teal for premium feel. If they're classic Vegas-style, go with black and gold. Red signals aggression and urgency, which isn't what most casino players want. They want escapism, fun, and visual pleasure. Red delivers none of those.
