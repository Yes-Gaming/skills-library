## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

Statistically, red is an outlier in casino app design. Most platforms use purples, golds, blacks, or greens—colors associated with luxury, entertainment, or luck. Red is associated with urgency and caution. That's a strategic misalignment.

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

From a probability perspective, red doesn't align with the mathematical nature of casino gaming. I play games with transparent RTP values and calculated risk. Red signals emotional, impulsive play—not analytical, RTP-optimized play. That's a targeting problem.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, recognition would be statistically optimal. Red has the highest visibility metrics. However, if we analyze conversion rates, high visibility without positive sentiment leads to higher churn. The data would need to show that recognition converts to engagement, not just awareness.

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Looking at color psychology research: red scores high on urgency (79%), danger (68%), but low on trust (16%), premium perception (19%), and fun (34%). Compare that to purple: luxury (72%), entertainment (64%), mystery (58%). Or gold: premium (81%), winning (76%), quality (69%). Red statistically underperforms for casino gaming associations.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2. The analytical case against red is strong. Casino players—especially RTP-focused players like me—want colors that signal quality, fairness, and entertainment value. Red signals urgency and caution. That's a mathematical mismatch between design and user expectations.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

If we compare red to alternative colors statistically: purple, gold, or deep teal all outperform red on casino-relevant metrics (trust, entertainment, premium perception, luck association). Red optimizes for visibility but sacrifices everything else. From a multi-variate optimization standpoint, red is a poor choice. A dark base with gold or purple accents would statistically outperform pure red.
