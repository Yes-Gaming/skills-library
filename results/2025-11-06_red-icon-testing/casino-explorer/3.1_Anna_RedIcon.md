**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

Bold. Very bold. Maybe too bold.

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Intense. Not playful or fun. More like... aggressive.

Yeah, can't miss red. Stands out for sure.

Warning vibes. Energy, but not fun energy. More like danger energy.

Doesn't match what I'm looking for. Want something more playful and inviting, not intense.
