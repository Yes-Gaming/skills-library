## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

Manipulation. Pure manipulation. Red is psychological warfare disguised as design.

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Like I'm being targeted by someone who read a basic psychology textbook and decided to weaponize it. Red = urgency = impulsivity = more spending. I see exactly what's happening here, and I hate it. It's exploitative.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, I'd recognize it the same way I recognize a warning label on a toxic substance. High visibility for all the wrong reasons.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Danger, caution, gambling addiction warnings, predatory design. Red is literally the color used in responsible gambling messages—"Stop. Think. Do you have a problem?" Using it as your brand color is either incredibly tone-deaf or cynically intentional. Either way, it's bad.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

1. Absolutely hate it. This is the gambling industry at its worst—using psychological manipulation to maximize engagement at the expense of user well-being. If you care about ethical design, red is disqualified immediately.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

Red says, "We know what we're doing, and we're doing it anyway." It's the color choice of a platform that prioritizes profits over player well-being. If you want users who are psychologically aware—especially younger, educated users—red will drive them away. We see through it.
