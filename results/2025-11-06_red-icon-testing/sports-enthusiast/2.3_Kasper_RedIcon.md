## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

Red flags. Literally. I work in sports media and I know exactly what red is designed to do—trigger urgency and impulsive behavior.

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

It feels predatory. The gambling industry already has a problem with exploiting emotional decision-making, and red is the color that maximizes that exploitation. It's not subtle. You're basically saying, "We want you in a heightened emotional state." That's concerning.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Sure, but so would a flashing neon sign that says "waste your money here." Visibility isn't the issue—intent is. High visibility for the wrong reasons is worse than low visibility.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Caution, warning, danger, stop signs, addiction warnings. Red is literally the color used on responsible gambling messages. Using it as your primary brand color is tone-deaf at best, cynically manipulative at worst. It also feels cheap—like bargain bin or clearance sale aesthetics.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

1. I hate it. As someone who covers the gambling industry professionally, I see red as a symbol of everything wrong with predatory platform design. If you want credibility, especially in Nordic markets with strong consumer protection values, red is the worst choice.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

Red tells me you prioritize short-term engagement over long-term trust. That's a red flag for users like me who are aware of industry tactics. If you want to be taken seriously in markets with informed consumers, choose a color that signals responsibility, not urgency.
