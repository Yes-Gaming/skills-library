## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

The way I see it, red immediately signals intensity and action. For a sports betting app, that has some logic to it—you want to capture the emotional energy of live sports. But it's also a bit heavy-handed. Red doesn't leave much room for subtlety.

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Red creates urgency, which aligns with live betting scenarios where you're making quick decisions during a match. That's the positive interpretation. The negative interpretation is that red could induce stress or impulsive decision-making, which isn't ideal for strategic betting. I approach betting analytically, and red feels like it's designed for emotional, not rational, decisions.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Absolutely. Red is highly visible. If I need to place a bet quickly during a live match, red ensures I can locate the app instantly. From a functional standpoint, it's effective. But effectiveness in recognition doesn't necessarily translate to effectiveness in brand perception.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Red gives me: urgency, intensity, action, caution, and alert signals. It doesn't communicate premium quality or trustworthiness—it communicates "act now." That might work for impulse betting, but it doesn't work for someone like me who studies statistics and makes calculated bets. I'd prefer a color that suggests sophistication and data-driven decision-making.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2.5. I understand the strategic logic for high-energy, impulse-driven users, but it alienates analytical users like me. Red feels like it's optimizing for emotional engagement rather than strategic credibility. That's a trade-off that could cost you the more sophisticated betting segment.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

Red positions you as an action-first, emotion-driven platform. If that's your target market, fine. But if you want to attract serious, data-driven bettors who value odds analysis and market depth, red sends the wrong signal. Consider darker, more sophisticated colors—navy, charcoal, deep green—that communicate intelligence and strategy rather than pure adrenaline.
