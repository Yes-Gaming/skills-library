## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a RED app icon on your home screen?**

As a UX researcher, my first reaction is: this is prioritizing attention over experience. Red grabs attention, but at what cost to user trust and long-term engagement?

---

**Q2: How does RED make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Red feels manipulative. It's using urgency psychology to drive engagement rather than providing genuine value. For a unified entertainment platform, that's particularly problematic because you need users to trust you across multiple verticals—sports, casino, account management. Red signals "act now, don't think," which is the opposite of trust.

---

**Q3: Would RED help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, but recognition without positive sentiment is worthless. In UX research, we measure both awareness AND affinity. Red maximizes awareness but minimizes affinity, especially among educated users who recognize psychological manipulation when they see it.

---

**Q4: Does RED give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Red gives me: manipulation, urgency, caution, cheap attention-seeking tactics. It doesn't give me trust, sophistication, or quality. Platforms claiming to offer unified, integrated experiences need to look unified and integrated—calm, professional, cohesive. Red is the opposite: it's chaotic, urgent, and fragmented.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a RED app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

1. From a UX research standpoint, red fails on multiple dimensions: trust, versatility, premium perception, and long-term engagement. It might drive initial downloads through shock value, but it will hemorrhage users over time as they realize the app is optimized for urgency rather than value.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about RED as our brand color for the app icon?**

Red is what happens when marketing overrides UX. It's optimizing for a single metric—attention—while ignoring every other metric that matters: trust, satisfaction, retention, perceived quality. For a unified platform, that's especially damaging because you need users to trust you across multiple high-stakes interactions. Red undermines that trust from the first visual touchpoint.
