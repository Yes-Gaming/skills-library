## Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a GOLDEN app icon on your home screen?

Yo, that's actually pretty slick! Gold just looks... expensive, you know? Like you're opening something special. I'm into it!

---

## Q2: How does the color GOLDEN make you feel in a gaming or entertainment context?

It makes me feel like I'm about to WIN something! Gold = winning, trophies, being the best! It's got that champion energy, that "I'm on top" vibe. Love it! It's exciting but also kinda classy at the same time. Not as crazy as like, neon colors, but still has punch.

---

## Q3: Would a GOLDEN icon help you find and recognize the Yes Games app quickly on your screen?

Hell yeah! It's gonna pop right out! Most of my apps are blue, black, red... gold would be SO easy to spot. I'd find it in like half a second. Perfect for when I'm trying to play quick between shifts.

---

## Q4: Does GOLDEN give you any specific associations - like energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, or anything else?

Premium for sure! It's got that VIP feeling, like you're in an exclusive club. It's not screaming FUN FUN FUN like yellow might, but it's got this... sophisticated excitement? Like champagne bottles and celebration vibes. Definitely makes me think of rewards and winning big!

---

## Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate this GOLDEN app icon? (1=terrible, 5=excellent)

**Rating: 5/5**

Dude, solid 5! This is awesome! It stands out, it looks premium, it's got that winning energy. I'd absolutely download this. It looks way better than those boring blue betting apps everyone has. This has STYLE!

---

## Q6: Any other thoughts or feelings about GOLDEN as the brand color for a gaming app?

I think it's perfect! Gaming should feel exciting and aspirational, right? Gold does exactly that. It's not too serious, but it's not childish either. It's got that sweet spot of "I could win big here" energy. Makes me want to open the app just looking at it. Way better than generic colors. This would look sick on my home screen!
