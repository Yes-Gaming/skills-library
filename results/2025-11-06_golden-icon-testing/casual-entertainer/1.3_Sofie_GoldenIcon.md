## Interview Context
Sofie is being shown the Yes Games app icon concept:
- GOLDEN/GOLD colored background
- "YES" logotype in center
- Mobile home screen appearance

---

## Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a GOLDEN app icon on your home screen?

Honestly? This feels like it's trying to be classy or premium. I'm immediately skeptical because a lot of gambling apps try to dress themselves up with gold to seem more legitimate than they actually are. It's a marketing tactic - make it look expensive so people think it's trustworthy.

---

## Q2: How does the color GOLDEN make you feel in a gaming or entertainment context?

It makes me feel like they're selling me something. Gold = money, wealth, winning big. It's very calculated. I don't trust it because it feels like they're using color psychology to manipulate me into thinking this is some premium, exclusive experience when it's just... gambling. Like, we all know what this is, right?

---

## Q3: Would a GOLDEN icon help you find and recognize the Yes Games app quickly on your screen?

Yeah, I mean, it would stand out. That's the point, isn't it? They want you to see it, tap it, spend money. It's visible, sure. But visibility doesn't equal trustworthiness.

---

## Q4: Does GOLDEN give you any specific associations - like energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, or anything else?

This feels like they're going for "premium" but it could easily tip into "cheap trying to look expensive" depending on execution. Gold can be classy or it can be gaudy. I'm thinking Vegas casino vibes - lots of gold everywhere, but is it actually high-quality? Or is it just flashy to distract you? I'd need to see the actual implementation. But my gut says they're using gold to make gambling seem more acceptable or upscale.

---

## Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate this GOLDEN app icon? (1=terrible, 5=excellent)

**Rating: 3/5**

I'll give it a 3. It's not terrible - it would be distinctive and recognizable. But I don't like how it's clearly using gold to seem premium or trustworthy when the color itself doesn't actually mean the company behind it is trustworthy. It's marketing manipulation. If they wanted my trust, they'd focus on transparency and regulation, not a shiny gold icon.

---

## Q6: Any other thoughts or feelings about GOLDEN as the brand color for a gaming app?

I think it's... calculated. They know gold makes people think of wealth and winning. They know it stands out. They know it codes as "premium." But that doesn't mean it's authentic. As a marketing student, I see through this - they're leveraging aspirational psychology. Will it work on some people? Absolutely. Does that make me trust them more? No. I'd rather see honest branding that doesn't try so hard to look fancy.
