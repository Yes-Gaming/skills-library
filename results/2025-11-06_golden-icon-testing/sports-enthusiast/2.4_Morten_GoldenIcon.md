## Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a GOLDEN app icon on your home screen?

YES! This is it! Gold is literally the color of WINNING! Championships, trophies, medals - everything I coach for! It's got that champion energy right there on the home screen!

---

## Q2: How does the color GOLDEN make you feel in a gaming or entertainment context?

Absolutely love it! It makes me feel like I'm going for GOLD! Like when you watch the Olympics or see the Premier League trophy being lifted - it's all gold! It's got that perfect mix of excitement and class. Not too wild, not too boring. Just... champion vibes all the way!

## Q3: Would a GOLDEN icon help you find and recognize the Yes Games app quickly on your screen?

100%! It's gonna shine on my phone like a trophy in a cabinet! I'd spot it instantly! During a live match when I need to adjust my bets quickly, I need that kind of instant recognition. Gold delivers!

## Q4: Does GOLDEN give you any specific associations - like energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, or anything else?

Energy: YES! Premium: ABSOLUTELY! It's got that winner's energy - the rush you feel when your team scores, when a bet comes through, when everything goes RIGHT! It's not screaming like neon colors, but it's got serious "I'm here to WIN" energy. Makes me think of podiums, celebrations, champagne moments!

## Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate this GOLDEN app icon? (1=terrible, 5=excellent)

**Rating: 5/5**

Solid 5! This is EXACTLY what a sports betting app should look like! It captures the emotion and thrill of sports perfectly! When I open this app during a Superliga match, I want to feel that rush, that possibility of victory - and gold delivers that feeling instantly! It's professional but exciting! LOVE IT!

---

## Q6: Any other thoughts or feelings about GOLDEN as the brand color for a gaming app?

I think it's perfect for sports! Football is about trophies, about going for gold, about that winning moment. This icon captures that spirit perfectly. It's not just another generic betting app - it's got personality, it's got ambition! Every time I'd see it on my phone, I'd feel that excitement. That's exactly what you want from a sports betting brand! It makes the experience feel bigger, more meaningful! Absolutely brilliant choice!
