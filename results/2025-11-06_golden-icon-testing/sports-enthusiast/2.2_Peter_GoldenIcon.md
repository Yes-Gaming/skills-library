## Interview Context
Peter is being shown the Yes Games app icon concept:
- GOLDEN/GOLD colored background
- "YES" logotype in center
- Mobile home screen appearance

---

## Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a GOLDEN app icon on your home screen?

The way I see it, gold immediately connotes achievement in sports contexts. Premier League trophies, Champions League medals, Olympic gold - these are the reference points my brain goes to. So from a sports betting perspective, it's subconsciously communicating "winning" before I even open the app. That's smart psychological anchoring.

---

## Q2: How does the color GOLDEN make you feel in a gaming or entertainment context?

It makes me feel like the platform is positioning itself as the premium choice. If you analyze the color choices of major betting platforms - Bet365 uses green and yellow, Unibet uses green, Betfair uses yellow and black - gold would differentiate significantly. It suggests higher quality, better odds, more professional operation. Whether that's actually true is another question, but the perception is there.

---

## Q3: Would a GOLDEN icon help you find and recognize the Yes Games app quickly on your screen?

Because if you analyze typical app icon colors on a bettor's phone, you've got finance apps (blues), social media (multicolor), sports apps (reds and whites), existing betting apps (greens and yellows). Gold creates categorical distinction. During live betting when I need to access the app quickly during a match, that differentiation matters. Recognition time is probably 30-40% faster than if it used a common color. So yes, objectively better findability.

---

## Q4: Does GOLDEN give you any specific associations - like energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, or anything else?

Premium and achievement are the primary associations. In terms of trust... that's interesting. Gold doesn't have the institutional trust signals that blue conveys - banks use blue for reliability. But in a sports betting context, gold might actually be more appropriate because it emphasizes the aspirational aspect: you're betting to win, to achieve, to be successful. That said, for risk-averse bettors, gold might feel too flashy. It depends on the target demographic's sophistication level.

## Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate this GOLDEN app icon? (1=terrible, 5=excellent)

**Rating: 4/5**

I'd give it a 4 out of 5. Here's my analysis: It's strategically differentiated, it leverages sports achievement psychology effectively, and it positions the brand in a premium segment which could support better margins and serious bettor acquisition. I'm not giving it a 5 because gold can sometimes read as too aspirational or exclusive - it might create psychological distance for casual bettors who just want to put 100 DKK on the Superliga match. But for the platform's likely target market (regular bettors with 500+ DKK monthly budgets), it's a strong choice.

---

## Q6: Any other thoughts or feelings about GOLDEN as the brand color for a gaming app?

From a market positioning standpoint, I think it's smart. The Scandinavian betting market is crowded, and most platforms use similar color schemes. Gold creates distinctiveness. My concern would be execution - the shade matters enormously. Too yellow-gold feels cheap, too brass-gold feels old-fashioned, but a proper metallic gold with good contrast against the YES typography? That could be genuinely premium and memorable. I'd want to see the actual implementation before final judgment, but conceptually, it's sound strategic thinking for a sports betting platform.
