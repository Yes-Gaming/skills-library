## Interview Context
Kasper is being shown the Yes Games app icon concept:
- GOLDEN/GOLD colored background
- "YES" logotype in center
- Mobile home screen appearance

---

## Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a GOLDEN app icon on your home screen?

Most betting apps use gold or yellow to signal big wins and excitement. I'm skeptical because this feels like another attempt to use aspirational branding to mask what is fundamentally a gambling product. The industry loves gold because it makes people think of jackpots and trophies, but it doesn't actually tell you if the odds are fair or if the platform is trustworthy.

---

## Q2: How does the color GOLDEN make you feel in a gaming or entertainment context?

It makes me feel like they're selling a fantasy. Gold = riches, winning big, being on top. But the reality is most bettors lose money. So using gold feels... manipulative? Like they're leveraging color psychology to create aspirational associations that don't match the statistical reality of gambling. As someone who covers the industry, I see through this tactic.

---

## Q3: Would a GOLDEN icon help you find and recognize the Yes Games app quickly on your screen?

I mean, yeah, it would be visible. That's tactical - they want you to see it, tap it, place bets. Visibility serves their business model, not necessarily the user's best interest. But objectively, yes, it would stand out.

---

## Q4: Does GOLDEN give you any specific associations - like energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, or anything else?

Most betting apps... but this one... look, gold is trying to position as "premium" or "exclusive," but I'm skeptical because premium should mean better odds, transparent RTP, strong responsible gambling tools. A gold icon doesn't guarantee any of that. It's surface-level branding. In my experience covering the industry, the platforms with the flashiest branding often have the worst terms buried in fine print.

---

## Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate this GOLDEN app icon? (1=terrible, 5=excellent)

**Rating: 3/5**

I'll give it a 3. It's not terrible from a design standpoint - it would be recognizable and differentiated. But I can't rate it higher because I question the ethics of using aspirational gold branding for a gambling product. It's designed to make you feel like a winner before you've even placed a bet, and that's... problematic. If they're a genuinely good platform with fair practices, they shouldn't need to rely so heavily on psychological color tricks.

---

## Q6: Any other thoughts or feelings about GOLDEN as the brand color for a gaming app?

I think the gambling industry uses gold and yellow excessively because it taps into winner fantasies. Yes, it's effective marketing. But as a journalist who's interviewed problem gamblers and covered regulatory failures, I'm wary of any branding that oversells the aspirational side without equally emphasizing the risks. A gold icon says "you could win big!" A responsible platform should also be saying "you could lose big." Color choice alone doesn't make a platform trustworthy - licensing, transparency, and responsible gambling tools do.
