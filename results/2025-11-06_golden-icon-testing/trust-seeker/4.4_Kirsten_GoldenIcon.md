## Interview Context
Kirsten is being shown the Yes Games app icon concept:
- GOLDEN/GOLD colored background
- "YES" logotype in center
- Mobile home screen appearance

---

## Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a GOLDEN app icon on your home screen?

Love it, but only if they're actually as good as they look! Gold is beautiful and sophisticated, but I've learned to be careful. Some gambling sites use pretty branding but then don't have proper responsible gambling tools or clear licensing. So my first reaction is: "This looks nice, but prove to me you're trustworthy."

---

## Q2: How does the color GOLDEN make you feel in a gaming or entertainment context?

It makes me feel like they're aiming for quality and class, which I appreciate! I'm not interested in those flashy, desperate-looking gambling apps. Gold feels more mature and responsible. But here's the thing - looks fun AND safe is what I need. Gold covers the "looks professional" part, but I need to see responsible gambling messages, clear limits, and Spillemyndigheden licensing to feel safe.

---

## Q3: Would a GOLDEN icon help you find and recognize the Yes Games app quickly on your screen?

Yes, definitely! It's distinctive and easy to spot. That's practical for weekend entertainment. But quick recognition is secondary to knowing I can trust the platform with my money and personal information.

---

## Q4: Does GOLDEN give you any specific associations - like energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, or anything else?

Trust is key! Gold gives me premium and quality associations, which is good. It doesn't scream "cheap gimmick" like some bright yellow or neon colors might. But trust specifically? That comes from seeing proper licensing badges, responsible gambling tools prominently displayed, and good reviews from other users my age. Gold is a positive signal, but it's not enough by itself. I need to see they take player protection seriously.

## Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate this GOLDEN app icon? (1=terrible, 5=excellent)

**Rating: 4/5**

I'd give it a 4! I really like how sophisticated and professional it looks. It's exactly the kind of branding that makes me feel like they're targeting responsible adults, not reckless gamblers. Gold feels trustworthy in that sense. I'm not giving it a 5 because ultimately, the icon is just the surface - what really matters is whether they have good customer service, clear terms, proper safeguards, and treat players fairly. But as far as first impressions go? This is very good.

---

## Q6: Any other thoughts or feelings about GOLDEN as the brand color for a gaming app?

I think gold is an excellent choice for a gambling platform that wants to attract mature, responsible players like me. It's not childish, it's not aggressive, it's not desperate for attention. It says "we're professional, we're quality." That's exactly what I want to see. My only advice would be: make sure the experience behind the gold icon lives up to that promise. Show me the Spillemyndigheden license right away, make responsible gambling tools easy to access, be transparent about odds and terms. If they do that, gold is perfect. If they don't, then it's just a pretty facade, and that would be disappointing.
