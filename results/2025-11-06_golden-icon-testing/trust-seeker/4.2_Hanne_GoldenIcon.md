## Interview Context
Hanne is being shown the Yes Games app icon concept:
- GOLDEN/GOLD colored background
- "YES" logotype in center
- Mobile home screen appearance

---

## Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a GOLDEN app icon on your home screen?

The reason I trust/don't trust this is... because when you consider what gold represents, it's aspirational and premium, which can be positive. However, in my experience with financial services and gambling platforms, the ones that rely heavily on gold branding are sometimes compensating for weaker actual services. I'd need to see the platform's Spillemyndigheden licensing, their responsible gambling tools, and their terms of service before forming a trust judgment based on the icon.

---

## Q2: How does the color GOLDEN make you feel in a gaming or entertainment context?

It makes me feel like they're positioning as upscale or premium. That's not inherently bad, but I've seen many platforms use premium branding while having unclear terms or poor customer service. Gold says "we're high-quality," but I need evidence beyond color choice. In my accounting work, I've learned that appearances can be deceiving - I want to see transparency in RTP, clear withdrawal policies, and visible regulatory compliance.

## Q3: Would a GOLDEN icon help you find and recognize the Yes Games app quickly on your screen?

Yes, it would be distinct and recognizable. That's a practical benefit. However, findability isn't my primary concern when choosing a gambling platform. I'm more focused on whether I can trust them with my financial information, whether their games are fair, and whether they have proper safeguards for responsible gambling.

---

## Q4: Does GOLDEN give you any specific associations - like energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, or anything else?

Gold gives me premium associations, certainly. But trust? That's more complex. Trust, in my view, comes from transparency, proper licensing, clear terms, responsive customer service, and a track record of fair dealing. Gold can signal quality, but it doesn't automatically signal trustworthiness. I've seen too many financial products use gold to appear premium while hiding unfavorable terms in fine print. So while gold looks professional, I remain cautious until I verify the platform's actual trustworthiness through research.

---

## Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate this GOLDEN app icon? (1=terrible, 5=excellent)

**Rating: 4/5**

I'd give it a 4 out of 5. Here's my reasoning: From a purely visual and professional standpoint, gold is sophisticated and distinctive. It's not garish or childish, which I appreciate. It suggests they're targeting a more mature, quality-conscious audience. I'm not giving it a 5 because an icon alone doesn't determine trustworthiness, and I've learned to separate appearance from substance. But if the platform backs up the premium visual identity with actual premium service - transparent RTP, strong security, clear responsible gambling tools - then the gold makes sense.

---

## Q6: Any other thoughts or feelings about GOLDEN as the brand color for a gaming app?

I think gold is a reasonable choice for a gambling platform targeting adults who value quality and professionalism. It's more refined than the bright yellows and reds many platforms use. However - and this is critical - the visual identity must match the operational reality. If they use gold to appear premium but then have slow withdrawals, unclear terms, or poor customer service, that's misleading branding. I'd want to see: Spillemyndigheden license prominently displayed, clear RTP information on all games, transparent withdrawal timeframes, and robust responsible gambling tools. If those exist, then gold is a fitting choice. If not, it's just premium window dressing.
