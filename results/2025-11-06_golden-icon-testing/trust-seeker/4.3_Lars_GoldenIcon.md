**Persona:** Lars, 44
**Location:** Odense, Seden
**Occupation:** IT security consultant
**Communication Style:** Highly skeptical, security-focused
**Interview Date:** November 6, 2025

## Interview Context
Lars is being shown the Yes Games app icon concept:
- GOLDEN/GOLD colored background
- "YES" logotype in center
- Mobile home screen appearance

---

## Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a GOLDEN app icon on your home screen?

This concerns me because premium visual branding often masks security deficiencies. I've audited enough systems to know that companies spending heavily on brand aesthetics sometimes underinvest in actual security infrastructure. Gold says "we look expensive," but I want to know: what's their SSL implementation, what's their data encryption standard, how do they handle PII, what's their incident response protocol?

---

## Q2: How does the color GOLDEN make you feel in a gaming or entertainment context?

Security-wise, it makes me suspicious. Gold is marketing theater - it's designed to make you feel the platform is premium and therefore trustworthy. But that's a logical fallacy. Some of the worst security breaches I've seen came from platforms with beautiful branding. The 2019 gambling platform breach that exposed 150,000 Danish users' data? That platform had slick gold and black branding. Visual identity has zero correlation with security posture.

---

## Q3: Would a GOLDEN icon help you find and recognize the Yes Games app quickly on your screen?

Irrelevant to my decision criteria. I don't choose platforms based on icon aesthetics. I choose based on: security certifications (ISO 27001), encryption standards (AES-256 minimum), regulatory compliance (Spillemyndigheden), vulnerability disclosure policy, and bug bounty programs. Icon color is cosmetic.

---

## Q4: Does GOLDEN give you any specific associations - like energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, or anything else?

I don't trust this because gold branding is often inversely correlated with actual security investment. Premium positioning costs money - money that could be spent on security infrastructure. I'd want to see their security audit reports, their penetration testing schedule, their data handling policies. Gold tells me they value brand perception. It doesn't tell me they value user data protection. Those are different priorities, and in gambling where you're handling financial transactions, security should be priority one.

---

## Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate this GOLDEN app icon? (1=terrible, 5=excellent)

**Rating: 2/5**

I'll give it a 2. Yes, it's visually distinctive. But as an IT security professional, I'm deeply skeptical of platforms that lead with premium branding instead of security credentials. The gambling industry has terrible security practices on average - weak encryption, poor access controls, inadequate logging. Using gold to appear trustworthy without proving actual security posture is, frankly, deceptive. Show me your SOC 2 Type II report, your penetration test results, your encryption standards. Then we can talk about whether gold is appropriate.

---

## Q6: Any other thoughts or feelings about GOLDEN as the brand color for a gaming app?

From a security perspective, I'm concerned that gold represents brand-first, security-second thinking. The platforms I trust don't need flashy branding - they demonstrate trustworthiness through transparent security practices. If Yes Games used that gold in their App Store listing to highlight their ISO 27001 certification, their AES-256 encryption, their regular third-party security audits - that would be appropriate premium positioning. But if it's just cosmetic branding without security substance? That's a red flag. I've seen this pattern too many times: beautiful frontend, vulnerable backend. Gold doesn't encrypt user data. Gold doesn't prevent SQL injection attacks. Show me the security, then choose your color.
