## Interview Context
Jens is being shown the Yes Games app icon concept:
- GOLDEN/GOLD colored background
- "YES" logotype in center
- Mobile home screen appearance

---

## Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a GOLDEN app icon on your home screen?

Looks expensive. Makes me wonder if it's trustworthy or just flashy.

---

## Q2: How does the color GOLDEN make you feel in a gaming or entertainment context?

Makes me think they're trying to look more premium than they might be. Gold can go either way - classy or tacky.

---

## Q3: Would a GOLDEN icon help you find and recognize the Yes Games app quickly on your screen?

Yeah, it would stand out. That's not really my concern though.

---

## Q4: Does GOLDEN give you any specific associations - like energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, or anything else?

Premium, yes. Trust? Not automatically. I need to see licensing and security, not just a gold icon. Color doesn't equal trustworthy.

---

## Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate this GOLDEN app icon? (1=terrible, 5=excellent)

**Rating: 3/5**

It's fine. Not bad, not amazing. Looks professional enough, but I judge platforms on security and licensing, not icon color.

---

## Q6: Any other thoughts or feelings about GOLDEN as the brand color for a gaming app?

It's okay. Better than bright yellow or red that screams "gamble now!" Gold is more subdued. But honestly, at my age, I care more about whether they're properly licensed and have good customer service than what color the icon is.
