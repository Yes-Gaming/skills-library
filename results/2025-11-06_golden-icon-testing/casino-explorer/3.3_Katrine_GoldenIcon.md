## Interview Context
Katrine is being shown the Yes Games app icon concept:
- GOLDEN/GOLD colored background
- "YES" logotype in center
- Mobile home screen appearance

---

## Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a GOLDEN app icon on your home screen?

This seems designed to trigger aspirational thinking. Gold activates reward pathways in the brain - it's associated with winning, wealth, success. Using it for a gambling app is psychologically calculated to make you think "this is where I'll win big." I see the tactic clearly.

---

## Q2: How does the color GOLDEN make you feel in a gaming or entertainment context?

It makes me feel like they're using classical conditioning. In gaming psychology, gold = reward. Loot boxes use gold coloring, premium currencies are gold, achievement badges are gold. They're leveraging that existing psychological conditioning to create positive associations with their gambling product. It's sophisticated manipulation - not necessarily unethical, but definitely intentional.

## Q3: Would a GOLDEN icon help you find and recognize the Yes Games app quickly on your screen?

Yes, it would be visible. But visibility serves the business model: the more you see it, the more you're reminded to open it and gamble. From a behavioral design perspective, this is about increasing engagement frequency through visual salience. It's effective, but we should be honest about what it's designed to do.

---

## Q4: Does GOLDEN give you any specific associations - like energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, or anything else?

I'm suspicious of how gold is being used here. In consumer psychology, gold signals exclusivity and premium quality - but it's often used by brands to elevate perception beyond what the product actually delivers. It's aspirational branding. The question is: does the platform's actual service quality match the premium perception gold creates? Or is this just psychological window dressing for a standard gambling app? Gold says "you're special, you're a winner" - but statistically, most users will lose money.

## Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate this GOLDEN app icon? (1=terrible, 5=excellent)

**Rating: 3/5**

I'll give it a 3. From a pure design standpoint, it's effective - it would be recognizable, differentiated, and psychologically compelling. But I'm docking points because I question the ethics of using such strong aspirational psychology for a gambling product. Gold primes you to think about winning and wealth before you've even opened the app. That's powerful behavioral influence, and while it's legal and common in the industry, it doesn't sit well with me from a psychological ethics standpoint.

---

## Q6: Any other thoughts or feelings about GOLDEN as the brand color for a gaming app?

From an academic perspective, this is textbook operant conditioning meets aspirational branding. Gold leverages both learned associations (gold = rewards in gaming) and cultural associations (gold = wealth, success). It's designed to make you feel good about gambling by associating the action with positive outcomes. Does it work? Absolutely. Is it responsible? That depends on whether the platform also implements strong responsible gambling safeguards to counterbalance the aspirational messaging. Color psychology is powerful - with that power comes responsibility.
