        "question": "What's your first reaction when you see an ORANGE app icon with 'YES' on your home screen?",

However, consider whether sacrificing trust signals is worth it. Perhaps pair the bold color with trust-building design elements like clear licensing, security badges, responsible gambling messaging. The color alone isn't the full story."

        "question": "What's your first reaction when you see an ORANGE app icon with 'YES' on your home screen?",
