4. **Check persona-specific guides** for detailed targeting strategies

### For Product Teams
1. **Review tagline winners** - these create product expectations
2. **Check "Product Implications" sections** in persona reports
3. **Ensure promises match reality** - "Watch & Play" requires integrated streaming

## Methodology

### Test Design
- **Isolation:** Each round completely independent (no memory between rounds)
- **Randomization:** Tagline presentation order randomized each round
- **Authenticity:** Persona-based responses matching real user behaviors
- **Volume:** 10 rounds per persona per language for pattern validation

### Questions Asked Each Round
1. **Q1 (Preference):** Which tagline would make you MOST likely to click/download?
2. **Q2 (Reasoning):** Why? What appeals to you?
3. **Q3 (Rejection):** What's your reaction to your LEAST favorite?
4. **Q4 (Trust):** Which tagline feels most trustworthy or premium?

### Why This Methodology
- Prevents response bias through isolation
- Validates patterns through repetition
- Captures both quantitative (choice) and qualitative (reasoning) data
- Tests real decision-making scenarios (preference vs trust split)
