## Key Insights

### Why "Casino og sport gjort nemt" DOMINATES (100% / 100%):

**Identical Pattern to English:**
The Danish responses mirror English results perfectly - this persona has universal, language-independent requirements.

**Transparency & Directness:**
- "At least this one tells me exactly what they offer - casino and sports betting"
- "It tells me exactly what I'm getting – both casino and sports betting in one place"
- "This is the only option that shows respect for my time by actually telling me what they do"
- "I know what I'm getting into"

**Professional Communication:**
- "It's honest and direct. I know immediately this is a casino and sportsbook platform"
- "The fact that they're not trying to be clever or create false urgency tells me they might actually be focused on delivering a good service"
- "It's professional, clear, and doesn't oversell"

**Experience-Based Trust:**
- "After decades of seeing platforms come and go, I've learned that clear communication from the start usually means clear terms and conditions later"
- "I've been gambling for 25 years, I don't need clever wordplay. I need to know: is this a casino, sportsbook, both?"
- "Companies that are clear from the start tend to be clear all the way through"

### What This Persona STRONGLY Rejects:

**Spillet er i gang (most rejected):**
- "'Spillet er i gang' - what does that even mean? The game is on? Which game?"
- "It's vague marketing speak that tells me nothing"
- "My immediate thought is: which game? And why should I care that it's on?"
- "This creates questions instead of answering them"
- **Rejected as least favorite in 5/10 rounds**

**Leg gjort nemt:**
- "'Leg gjort nemt' - Play made easy. This is too vague to mean anything"
- "Calling it 'leg' (play) instead of gambling feels like they're trying to make it sound more innocent"
- "I respect platforms that call things what they are. Gambling is gambling, not 'leg'"
- "This kind of softening language makes me suspicious about what else they might not be straight about"
- **Rejected as least favorite in 3/10 rounds**

**Se og spil / Spil og se:**
- "'Se og spil' and 'Spil og se' are both equally frustrating - they're the same non-information"
- "Watch and play, play and watch - so what? These are action verbs with no object, no context, no meaning"
- "This kind of lazy, ambiguous messaging signals that the platform either doesn't know what makes them special, or they're deliberately being vague"
- **Rejected as least favorite in 2/10 rounds**
