- "Just sounds fun, you know? It's about having fun and it's saying it's gonna be easy"
- "The word 'leg' (play/fun) speaks to me way more than all the serious gambling language"

**Spil og se (30%):**

- "Kunne ikke være mere generisk" (Couldn't be more generic)

**Spillet er i gang:**

### Danish vs English Differences:

**English:** Clear 50/50 split between "Play & Watch" and "Watch & Play"
**Danish:** Fragmented - 4 different taglines received votes

**Why the difference?**
- "Leg gjort nemt" introduces playful Danish word ("leg") with no English equivalent tested
- Danish word order matters: "Spil og se" vs "Se og spil" both got votes (neither dominated)
- Rhyming/phonetics play bigger role in Danish ("Spil og se" mentioned as "rhyming")

### Universal Pattern: Trust Gap

Despite scattered preferences, **100%** still chose "Casino og sport gjort nemt" for trust - identical pattern to English version.
