## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a pink app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

That's unusual. Not what I'd expect for a gambling app. Makes me wonder what kind of operation they're running.

---

**Q2: How does pink make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Doesn't feel serious. Pink is too playful for something involving real money. I need to trust where my money goes. Pink doesn't give me that.

---

**Q3: Would pink help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Sure, I'd find it. But that's not my main concern. I want to know if it's legitimate and trustworthy. Color doesn't answer that.

---

**Q4: Does pink give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Fun, maybe. Playful. But not trustworthy. Not professional. For gambling, I need to see security and legitimacy. Pink doesn't signal that.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a pink app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2. Don't trust it. Feels too casual for something serious like gambling.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about pink as our brand color for the app icon?**

If they want my business, they need to look professional. Pink looks like they're trying to be trendy instead of trustworthy. I've been gambling for years—I know what a serious operation looks like. This isn't it.
