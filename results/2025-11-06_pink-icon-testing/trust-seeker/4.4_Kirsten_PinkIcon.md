## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a pink app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Oh, that's interesting! It's very different, isn't it? I have to say, my first thought is "Well, that's cheerful!" but my second thought is "Is this a proper gambling site?" Because pink isn't what I'm used to seeing for these kinds of apps.

**Q2: How does pink make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Pink makes me feel like it could be fun and friendly, which I appreciate! I love that feeling of excitement and positivity when I'm playing on the weekends. But—and this is important—I also need to feel safe. Gambling involves real money, and I need to know the platform is legitimate, licensed, and looking out for my wellbeing.

Pink gives me the "fun" part, but I'm not sure it gives me the "safe" part. Does that make sense? It's cheerful, which is lovely, but where's the signal that says "We're licensed by Spillemyndigheden" or "We have responsible gambling tools"?

I want both! I want fun AND trust. Pink gives me half of that equation.

**Q3: Would pink help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, absolutely! Pink would be so easy to spot. I'd find it right away, which is nice when I want to play for a bit on a Saturday evening.

But here's the thing: finding the app quickly doesn't help if I'm not sure I should be using it in the first place. I need to know it's trustworthy before convenience matters.

**Q4: Does pink give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Pink gives me:
- **Fun and happiness!** (I love that feeling)
- **Friendliness and warmth** (makes it seem approachable)
- **Playfulness** (which is nice for entertainment)
- **Cheerfulness** (positive energy)

But pink does NOT give me:
- **Trust and safety** (which I really need for gambling)
- **Seriousness about responsible gambling** (very important to me)
- **Professional credibility** (I want to know they're a real, established company)

So it's a bit of a mixed bag. The fun energy is there, but the trust signals aren't. And in gambling, I need both.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a pink app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

**3.5 out of 5.**

I'm giving it 3.5 because I genuinely appreciate the fun, positive energy pink brings! I like that Yes Games is willing to be different and try something cheerful rather than dark and serious like every other gambling app.

But I'm not giving it a 4 or 5 because I have concerns about trust. Pink makes me wonder:
- "Is this a serious, licensed operator?"
- "Will they take responsible gambling seriously?"
- "Is this a company I can trust with my money?"

If Yes Games can answer those questions positively—if they show me clear licensing information, strong responsible gambling tools, and professional customer support—then I could absolutely get past the pink icon. The color wouldn't matter if the substance is there.

But if pink is just aesthetic branding without substance behind it, I'd be disappointed. Fun energy is great, but it needs to be paired with real trustworthiness.

**Q6: Any other thoughts about pink as our brand color for the app icon?**

Yes, here's what I'd say to Yes Games:

**I love that you're trying to be different!** The gambling space is so dark and serious. Everything is black, gold, red—trying to look fancy or intense. Pink is refreshing! It feels like you're saying, "Hey, gambling can be fun and light without being scary or predatory." I appreciate that message.

**But please, PLEASE back it up with trust.**

Show me:
- **Visible Danish licensing** (Spillemyndigheden badge, front and center)
- **Clear responsible gambling tools** (deposit limits, self-exclusion, reality checks)
- **Transparent terms and conditions** (no hidden fees or confusing clauses)
- **Professional customer support** (real people who can help me if something goes wrong)
- **Positive reviews from other users** (real testimonials, not fake ones)

If you give me all of that, I'll happily use a pink app! The color won't matter because I'll know you're legitimate and caring. Pink can be the fun wrapper on a trustworthy platform.

But if you're just pink because you want to stand out in the App Store, and you don't actually have strong trust-building practices, I'll feel tricked. Pink will feel like a mask hiding a less-than-great platform.

**My advice:**
Go pink if you're willing to be the MOST trustworthy, MOST responsible gambling app on the market. Let pink represent a new kind of gambling platform—one that's fun AND safe, cheerful AND responsible, different AND trustworthy.

If you can be that, I'm on board! But if you're just pink without the substance, it's a missed opportunity.

I'm rooting for you! Just please make sure the trust is there. That's what matters most to someone like me who loves the excitement but also wants to feel safe.
