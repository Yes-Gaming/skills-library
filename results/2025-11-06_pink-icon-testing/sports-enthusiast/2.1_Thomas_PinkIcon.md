## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a pink app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Not what I'd expect for betting. Stands out though.

---

**Q2: How does pink make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Soft. Too soft for sports betting. Doesn't match the intensity of live matches.

---

**Q3: Would pink help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yeah, I'd find it. It's different. But feels off for what I'm doing—betting on football.

---

**Q4: Does pink give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Fun, I guess. Friendly. But not competitive. Not aggressive. Sports betting needs edge. Pink doesn't have that.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a pink app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

2. Don't hate it, but it doesn't fit. Wrong vibe for sports.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about pink as our brand color for the app icon?**

Might work for casual games. Not for sports betting. Need something that feels competitive, fast, strong. Pink's not that.
