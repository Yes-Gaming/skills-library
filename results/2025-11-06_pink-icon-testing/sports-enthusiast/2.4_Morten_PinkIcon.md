## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a pink app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Uhh, interesting! That's... definitely not what I expected for a betting app! It's different, I'll give it that. Makes me curious what the app is about.

**Q2: How does pink make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Hmm, it feels friendly! Like, it's not trying to be super serious or intimidating. Some betting apps feel really heavy and intense, you know? Pink is lighter. It's like, "Hey, come have fun, it's not that deep."

I like that it's approachable, but I'm also not sure it captures the RUSH of betting on a live match. When my team scores and my bet comes through, that feeling is electric! Pink feels more chill than electric, you know?

**Q3: Would pink help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Oh, FOR SURE! Pink would jump out immediately. I don't have any pink apps. It'd be super easy to spot when I need to place a quick bet during halftime. That's actually really useful!

**Q4: Does pink give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Pink gives me:
- **Fun!** (definitely)
- **Friendly and welcoming** (strong vibe)
- **Playful** (yeah, for sure)
- **Modern** (feels current)

It doesn't really give me:
- **Intensity or competitive edge** (which I love about sports betting)
- **That adrenaline feeling** (pink is too soft for that)
- **Premium or exclusive** (feels more accessible than fancy)

So it's got positive vibes, but it doesn't quite match the EMOTION of live sports betting. That's a bit of a miss for me.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a pink app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

**3.5 out of 5!**

I like that it's different and bold! I appreciate when brands take risks and do something unexpected. Pink definitely does that. It's memorable and easy to find.

But it's not a full 4 or 5 because it doesn't capture the intensity I love about sports betting. When I'm watching a match and my bet is on the line, I want the app to feel like it's in the game with me—fast, competitive, energetic. Pink feels more like a chill hangout than a competitive arena.

If they can make the app inside feel fast and exciting, maybe the pink wouldn't matter as much. But the icon sets a tone, and right now the tone feels a bit too soft for sports.

**Q6: Any other thoughts about pink as our brand color for the app icon?**

I think it's cool that Yes Games is willing to be different! The betting space is so samey—everyone uses dark colors and tries to look serious. Pink breaks that mold, and I respect that.

My advice would be: if you go pink, make sure the app inside delivers ENERGY. Pink is friendly and approachable, which is great, but don't lose the excitement and intensity that makes sports betting thrilling. Balance the softness of pink with features that amp up the emotion—live updates, fast betting, in-play action, celebration animations when you win.

If you can do that, pink could actually work really well. It'd be like, "We're friendly AND exciting." But if the app feels slow or boring, pink will just make it feel even more underwhelming.

Overall, I'm cautiously optimistic! It's bold, and I like bold. Just make sure you back it up with an app that matches the energy of the sport.
