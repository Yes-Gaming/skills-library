## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a pink app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

My first thought is: "What are they trying to do here?" Pink in the gambling space feels like a deliberate attempt to look friendly and non-threatening, which immediately makes me suspicious. Why does a betting app need to look non-threatening? What are they trying to hide behind the soft branding?

---

**Q2: How does pink make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Pink makes me feel like the company is trying to disarm me. In my work as a journalist covering the gambling industry, I've seen how operators use branding to soften the perception of risk. Pink is the ultimate "don't worry, we're harmless" color.

But gambling isn't harmless. It's a real-money activity with addiction risks, financial consequences, and regulatory oversight. Using pink to make it feel cute or friendly feels dishonest. It's like putting a cartoon mascot on a pack of cigarettes.

I'm not saying Yes Games is intentionally predatory, but the choice of pink raises questions for me. Is this about making users feel comfortable so they bet more? Is it about attracting users who might otherwise be cautious about gambling? Those are the questions I'd ask if I were writing an article about this.

**Q3: Would pink help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yes, it would be visible. But visibility isn't trust. Just because I can find it doesn't mean I want to use it. If anything, pink would make me more likely to question whether this is a serious, licensed, trustworthy platform or just a gimmick trying to capitalize on aesthetic trends.

---

**Q4: Does pink give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Pink gives me:
- **Manipulation concerns** (strong association for me)
- **Softness and friendliness** (which feels calculated)
- **Trendiness** (which feels shallow)
- **Lack of seriousness** (which is a problem for gambling)

It does NOT give me:
- **Trust** (absolutely not)
- **Transparency** (pink doesn't signal honesty to me)
- **Professionalism** (it signals the opposite)
- **Security** (pink feels weak, not strong)

If I'm being critical—and I am—pink feels like a color chosen by a marketing team trying to "disrupt" the category by looking different, without considering whether different is actually better. It's differentiation for differentiation's sake, not because it serves the user.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a pink app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

**2 out of 5.**

I'm giving it a 2 because I don't think it's offensively bad, but I think it's strategically misguided. Pink doesn't solve any real user problem. It doesn't make betting safer, more transparent, or more trustworthy. It just makes the app look different.

And in an industry where trust is everything—where users are literally handing over their money and personal data—looking different isn't enough. You need to look trustworthy, professional, and legitimate. Pink doesn't do that.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about pink as our brand color for the app icon?**

Yeah, here's my journalist take: if Yes Games launches with a pink icon, I'd write about it. And my angle would be: "Is this genuine innovation or aesthetic gimmickry?"

I'd ask:
- Why pink? What user need does this serve?
- Is Yes Games backing up the friendly branding with industry-leading responsible gambling tools?
- Are they more transparent about odds, RTP, and house edge than competitors?
- Are they doing more than the minimum required by Spillemyndigheden?

If the answers are yes, then pink might be defensible as part of a broader strategy to make gambling more approachable and honest. But if the answers are no—if pink is just a superficial branding choice on top of the same old mechanics—then it's cynical. It's using aesthetics to attract users without actually improving their experience or safety.

So my advice to Yes Games: only go pink if you're willing to back it up with substance. Otherwise, you're just asking for critical scrutiny. And as someone who covers this industry, I'll be watching.
