## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a pink app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Different. Stands out. Not sure it fits the all-in-one vibe though.

---

**Q2: How does pink make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Pink feels playful. But if you're going for unified platform—sports, casino, esports all in one—pink feels too casual. Doesn't signal "comprehensive platform."

---

**Q3: Would pink help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yeah, definitely. It'd pop. But that's not my main concern. I want one app that does everything well. Color doesn't tell me if you've got that.

---

**Q4: Does pink give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Fun. Friendly. But not unified or comprehensive. Pink feels like one thing, not everything. Mixed message for an all-in-one platform.

---

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a pink app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

3. It's okay. Eye-catching but doesn't match the unified positioning. Needs to feel integrated, not just fun.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about pink as our brand color for the app icon?**

If you're positioning as all-in-one, choose a color that signals completeness, not playfulness. Pink works for casual. Not sure it works for comprehensive.
