## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a pink app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Different. Not typical for a gaming app. Catches your eye, but in a weird way.

---

**Q2: How does pink make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Honestly? A bit confused. Pink feels more beauty app or social thing. Not what I expect for gambling. It's kind of... soft? Not sure it fits.

---

**Q3: Would pink help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yeah, it'd stand out. Not many pink apps on my screen. But would I remember it's a gaming app? Maybe not at first.

---

**Q4: Does pink give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Fun, I guess. Playful. But also kind of feminine? Not cheap, not premium either. Just... different. Not aggressive like red or energetic like yellow. Softer.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a pink app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

3. It's okay. Not hating it, but not excited either. It's different, which is good, but doesn't scream "gaming" to me.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about pink as our brand color for the app icon?**

It's bold to go pink. Could work if you want to be different. But make sure the app inside feels right with it. Pink promises something friendly and approachable—needs to deliver that.
