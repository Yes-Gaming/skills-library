## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a pink app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Whoa! That's DIFFERENT! I mean, you don't see pink gaming apps every day, right? It's bold! I dig that. Shows confidence. Like, "Yeah, we're pink, deal with it." That's kinda cool!

**Q2: How does pink make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Honestly? It's fun! Pink feels playful and light. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which I like. Some gambling apps are so dark and intense—all black and red like a hardcore casino. Pink is like, "Hey, let's have a good time." I'm into that vibe!

It's also kind of unexpected, which makes it exciting. Like, "Oh, this is gonna be different from the rest." I'm curious what the app would be like inside if the icon is pink. Feels fresh!

**Q3: Would pink help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

ABSOLUTELY! Pink would pop like crazy on my screen. I've got mostly blue, green, and dark apps. Pink would be the only one that color. I'd spot it instantly. Super easy to find when I'm scrolling through looking for something to play.

**Q4: Does pink give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Pink gives me:
- **FUN!** (100%)
- **Playful and lighthearted**
- **Friendly and welcoming**
- **Modern and trendy**

It doesn't feel cheap to me. It feels more... accessible? Like, it's not trying to be this exclusive high-roller thing. It's for everyone. I like that. It's inviting, not intimidating.

Premium? Ehh, not really. But I don't need a gambling app to feel "premium." I just want it to be fun and easy to use. Pink delivers on that.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a pink app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

**4.5 out of 5!**

I love it! It's bold, it's different, and it feels like a brand that's not afraid to do its own thing. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 is because I'd want to see the actual design. Like, what shade of pink? What font? How's the YES logo styled? That stuff matters.

But conceptually? LOVE the idea. It's refreshing. Gaming and gambling apps all look the same. Pink breaks that mold. That's exciting!

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about pink as our brand color for the app icon?**

Yeah, DO IT! Seriously, the gambling space is so boring and samey. Everyone's trying to look "serious" and "trustworthy" by using the same old colors. Pink says, "We trust ourselves enough to be different."

Plus, pink is trending right now. Look at brands like Glossier, Barbie, even T-Mobile. Pink is having a moment. If Yes Games can ride that wave and own pink in the gambling space, you'd be ahead of the curve.

Just make sure the app inside matches the vibe. If the icon is fun and pink, but the app is clunky and boring, people will be disappointed. The pink icon sets an expectation—deliver on it!

Overall, I think it's a sick choice. Bold, fun, memorable. I'm here for it!
