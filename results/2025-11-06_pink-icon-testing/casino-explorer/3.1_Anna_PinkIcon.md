## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a pink app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

Oh, that's cute! Different. Eye-catching for sure.

**Q2: How does pink make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Fun and playful. Maybe a bit too soft for slots and casino games though. I like bold graphics and energy. Pink feels gentle.

**Q3: Would pink help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yeah, definitely. It's unique. I'd spot it instantly. That's helpful when I want to play something quick.

**Q4: Does pink give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?**

Fun for sure. Friendly. Modern. Not premium though. And not really the intense vibe I usually go for in casino games.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a pink app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

3.5. I like that it's different and looks good, but I'm not sure it matches the excitement of casino gaming. Could work if the games inside are visually stunning.

---

**Q6: Any other thoughts about pink as our brand color for the app icon?**

Make sure the design is sleek. Pink can look cheap if not done right. But if it's a nice shade with good typography, could be pretty cool. Just needs to feel quality, not cutesy.
