## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Sofie:** Interesting choice. Purple is less obviously manipulative than red or yellow. It's not trying to trigger urgency or dopamine as aggressively. That's... actually refreshing? Still skeptical, but at least it's not screaming "BET NOW" with color psychology.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Sofie:** Purple feels more sophisticated, less like a psychological trap. I study marketing, so I know purple is used for premium positioning—luxury brands, creative industries. In gambling context, that's smarter than the typical aggressive tactics. It suggests you're confident enough in your product that you don't need to use warning colors or manipulation triggers. Still cautious about gambling apps in general, but purple doesn't immediately set off my "they're trying to trick me" alarm.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Sofie:** Yes, but not in the aggressive way yellow or red do. Purple stands out because it's different, not because it's shouting. That matters to me. I don't want to feel assaulted by my phone screen every time I look at it.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Sofie:** Premium, definitely. Creative. Somewhat mysterious, which could be good or bad depending on execution. Purple doesn't scream "cheap" or "discount," which is good. It also doesn't have the manipulation associations of red or the caution/warning vibes I get from yellow. From a trust perspective, it's neutral. Not as trustworthy as dark blue, but way better than red. Energy-wise, it's moderate—not frantic.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Sofie:** **3.5/5**. I'm impressed that you didn't go with the obvious manipulative choices. Purple shows some restraint and strategic thinking. But I'm inherently skeptical of gambling apps, so even the smart color choice doesn't fully win me over. The color is a good start, but I'd need to see operational transparency, clear responsible gambling tools, and genuine user protection before I'd trust any gambling platform.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Sofie:** This feels like someone in your organization actually thought about long-term brand perception instead of just short-term dopamine triggers. That's rare in gambling. Purple is a grown-up choice. If you back it up with grown-up operational practices—transparency, responsible gambling, no dark patterns—then this could actually work. But if purple is just a prettier wrapper around the same predatory tactics, then it's just sophisticated manipulation instead of obvious manipulation. The color is good. Don't ruin it with bad practices.
