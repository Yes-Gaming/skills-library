## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Sebastian:** The way I see it, purple is an excellent choice for a unified platform because when you think about integrated experiences, you need a color that's versatile enough to work across different contexts—sports betting (high energy), casino gaming (entertainment focus), account management (trust focus). Purple balances those requirements better than single-note colors like red (too intense for all contexts) or yellow (too cautious).

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Sebastian:** Purple feels premium and versatile. From a product perspective, unified platforms need to communicate sophistication and quality—users expect seamless integration, which requires technical excellence. Purple signals that level of quality. It's not trying to be everything to everyone (which leads to mediocrity), but it's sophisticated enough to work across sports, casino, and account contexts. Red would be too narrow—great for live betting, terrible for account security pages. Purple maintains appropriate tone across all touchpoints.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Sebastian:** Absolutely. Purple provides high differentiation in a crowded app ecosystem. For power users like me who have dozens of apps, recognition speed matters. Purple achieves that through strategic color positioning rather than sensory assault.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Sebastian:** The associations are premium (very high), quality (high), sophisticated (high), versatile (moderate-high), creative (high). Purple doesn't lock you into one emotional register—it can be energizing for sports betting while remaining appropriate for trust-critical account interactions. That versatility is exactly what unified platforms need. Trust is moderate, which is acceptable given the premium positioning compensates through quality signals.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Sebastian:** **4.5/5**. From a product strategy perspective, purple is an excellent choice for unified entertainment platforms. It signals quality and sophistication, works across multiple use cases, differentiates effectively, and avoids the manipulation concerns that red and yellow carry. The half-point deduction is just to account for execution—purple needs to be backed by genuine platform integration and quality experience. But strategically? This is really strong.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Sebastian:** Purple positions you well for the unified platform promise. Single-purpose platforms can get away with narrow colors—sports betting could use red, casino could use gold. But unified platforms need sophisticated brand identity that works everywhere. Purple delivers that. My advice: make sure your platform integration actually delivers on what purple promises. If you use premium brand identity but deliver fragmented experience, users will feel deceived. Purple sets a high bar—meet it.
