## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Caroline:** Statistically speaking, purple is underrepresented in app icon color distribution, which creates high differentiation value. Compared to the typical casino app palette—red (24%), black (28%), gold (18%)—purple represents strategic positioning outside the conventional cluster.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Caroline:** Looking at color psychology research, purple scores high on premium perception (72%), luxury associations (74%), and sophistication (68%). For casino gaming, those associations align well with the desired user experience. Compared to red, which triggers stress hormones and impulsive decision-making (bad for rational RTP-based game selection), purple maintains engagement without compromising analytical thinking. That's mathematically advantageous for players like me who make informed decisions.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Caroline:** The numbers show that purple usage in mobile apps is approximately 3-5%, creating high visual differentiation. Recognition speed correlates with color uniqueness in a given visual field. Purple would achieve top-quartile recognition efficiency.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Caroline:** Analyzing the association data: premium (72%), luxury (74%), quality (68%), creativity (65%), sophistication (71%). Low scores: cheap (12%), warning (7%), discount (9%). Trust is moderate (48-52%), which is acceptable for entertainment platforms. Compared to yellow (trust: 23%) and red (trust: 16%), purple's trust profile is statistically superior. Energy level is moderate (52%), supporting sustained engagement without decision-making impairment.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Caroline:** **4/5**. The statistical case for purple is strong. Differentiation metrics are excellent, premium perception is high, manipulation concerns are minimal, and psychological profile supports rational gameplay. Compared to tested alternatives—yellow (3.4/5) and red (2.6/5)—purple represents mathematically superior positioning.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Caroline:** From a mathematical game theory perspective, purple optimizes for both platform success and player experience. It attracts users through differentiation and premium positioning while avoiding psychological manipulation that undermines informed decision-making. For RTP-focused players like me, that balance is important. I want engaging design that doesn't compromise my ability to make rational probability-based decisions.
