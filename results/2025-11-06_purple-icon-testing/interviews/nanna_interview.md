## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Nanna:** Interesting. Purple is less commonly used, which could signal genuine differentiation or just trying to be different without substance. As a UX researcher, I evaluate whether design choices support user goals or just serve brand ego. Purple could work for unified platforms if executed properly.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Nanna:** Purple feels more sophisticated than typical gambling colors. From a UX perspective, unified platforms need colors that work across diverse contexts—sports betting (energy), casino (entertainment), account management (trust). Red is too single-note (intensity), yellow has caution associations. Purple has enough versatility to work across contexts without feeling generic. That's important for integration. But color alone doesn't create unified experience—you need consistent design system, seamless navigation, and coherent information architecture.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Nanna:** Yes. Purple differentiates without requiring aggressive attention-grabbing tactics. That's good UX—recognition through strategic positioning, not sensory overload.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Nanna:** Premium, sophisticated, quality, creative, somewhat mysterious. Purple doesn't have the manipulation red flags (literally) that I see in many gambling platforms. It also doesn't scream "discount" or "urgent." For multi-purpose platforms, that balanced perception is valuable. Trust is moderate—not banking-blue, but way better than red or yellow. Most importantly, purple doesn't create context-specific problems. It works reasonably well across sports, casino, and account contexts.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Nanna:** **4/5**. From a UX strategy perspective, purple is a smart choice for unified platforms. It's versatile, premium, and avoids major pitfalls. The one-point deduction reflects my inherent skepticism—most platforms have fragmented experiences behind pretty icons. Purple sets expectations for quality and integration. You have to deliver on those expectations, or users will feel deceived.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Nanna:** Purple is a good start, but it's just the first touchpoint. Unified platforms live or die based on actual experience coherence, not icon color. Purple suggests you're thinking about sophistication and quality, which is good. Just make sure your UX research, design system, and technical integration actually support unified experience. I've seen too many platforms with premium branding and terrible, fragmented UX. Don't be one of those.
