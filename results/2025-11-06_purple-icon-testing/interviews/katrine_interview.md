## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Katrine:** Interesting. Purple is less overtly manipulative than red or yellow. It's not screaming "URGENT! ACT NOW!" which is what I'd expect from typical gambling apps. Purple is more subtle, more sophisticated. That could be genuine strategic positioning or it could be sophisticated manipulation instead of obvious manipulation. I'm cautiously curious.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Katrine:** From a psychology perspective, purple doesn't trigger the same stress response that red does. Red activates fight-or-flight, increases heart rate, triggers urgency—all terrible for rational decision-making around money. Purple is calmer. It's associated with creativity, luxury, and mystery rather than danger or urgency. If I'm being honest, purple feels like a more ethical color choice for gambling because it's not designed to override rational thinking. But I'm still inherently skeptical of gambling design.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Katrine:** Yes, but not in a way that creates anxiety. Red and yellow grab attention through psychological arousal. Purple grabs attention through differentiation and aesthetic appeal. That's a better approach if you're not trying to manipulate users.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Katrine:** Purple associates with premium, luxury, creativity, sophistication, mystery. It doesn't have warning associations (red) or caution associations (yellow). Energy is moderate—engaging but not frantic. From a psychological ethics standpoint, purple is one of the less manipulative color choices. It doesn't exploit urgency, fear, or impulsivity triggers. That said, color alone doesn't make a platform ethical. Dark patterns can exist behind any color scheme.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Katrine:** **3.5/5**. I'm giving credit for not choosing the obvious manipulation colors (red, yellow). Purple suggests someone thought about long-term brand perception and user experience instead of just immediate engagement metrics. That's refreshing in gambling. However, I'm still skeptical of gambling apps in general, so even a smart color choice doesn't fully overcome my concerns. If you pair purple with genuinely ethical practices—transparent odds, strong responsible gambling tools, no dark patterns—then it could work well.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Katrine:** Purple is one of the better color choices from a psychological ethics perspective. It doesn't weaponize color psychology to trigger impulsive behavior. But here's the test: if you're choosing purple because it's sophisticated and builds long-term trust, that's good. If you're choosing purple because it's a more subtle form of manipulation that educated users won't immediately recognize, that's just sophisticated deception. The color is fine. Make sure your practices match the ethical tone it sets.
