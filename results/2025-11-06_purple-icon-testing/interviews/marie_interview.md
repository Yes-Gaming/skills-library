## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Marie:** If we compare this to other app icon colors in the gambling/gaming category, purple is statistically underrepresented, which creates differentiation. Looking at my home screen analytics, I have 87 apps installed—6 blue icons, 8 red, 4 yellow, 5 green, but only 1 purple (Roku). Purple would have minimal competition for attention, which is strategically smart.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Marie:** The data shows that purple scores well on premium perception (around 68-72% in consumer studies), creativity (65%), and luxury associations (74%). Compared to red (urgency: 79%, danger: 68%) or yellow (caution: 58%, playful: 71%), purple's psychological profile is more balanced. Energy level is moderate—not passive but not aggressive. For entertainment that involves financial decisions, that balance is analytically sound.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Marie:** Based on visual differentiation analysis, yes. Purple provides high contrast ratios on both light and dark backgrounds. Looking at the competitive landscape, most gambling apps use blue (42%), black (31%), or red (18%). Purple usage is <3%, meaning you'd achieve top-quartile recognition speed through strategic color differentiation rather than intensity-based attention-grabbing.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Marie:** Analyzing the associations: Premium (high correlation, 70%+), luxury (high, 74%), creativity (moderate-high, 65%), mystery (moderate, 52%), sophistication (high, 68%). Low associations with: cheap (12%), discount (8%), warning (7%). Trust metrics are moderate—not as high as blue (71% trust association) but significantly better than red (16% trust) or yellow (23% trust). Purple's trust score is estimated around 48-54%, which is acceptable for entertainment-finance hybrid category.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Marie:** **4/5**. The analytical case for purple is strong. Differentiation metrics are excellent, premium perception is high, trust deficit is minimal compared to alternatives, and psychological associations align well with product category requirements. The half-point deduction accounts for purple's moderate (not high) trust score—it's not optimal for pure financial services, but for entertainment-finance hybrid, the trade-off is justified. Compared to yellow (3.4/5 in previous testing) and red (2.6/5), purple is statistically superior.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Marie:** Looking at the data holistically, purple represents an optimal strategic position in the color-perception matrix. It maximizes differentiation while minimizing negative associations. The key success factors will be: (1) precise shade selection—too bright reduces premium perception, too dark reduces energy perception; (2) consistent brand system execution; (3) trust-building operational transparency to compensate for purple's moderate (not high) trust baseline. If executed properly, purple should outperform both yellow and red across all key metrics: recognition, trust, premium perception, and demographic appeal.
