## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Peter:** The way I see it, purple is an interesting strategic choice because if you analyze the competitive landscape in sports betting, most platforms use blue (Bet365, William Hill) or red/black combinations. Purple differentiates without sacrificing credibility. It signals sophistication and quality, which aligns with what strategic bettors like me look for.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Peter:** Purple feels balanced—it has energy for the excitement of live matches, but it's not the frantic, impulse-triggering energy of red. For strategic betting where I'm analyzing statistics and making calculated decisions, I don't want a color that's pushing me toward emotional, rushed bets. Purple feels measured, confident, and premium. That matches how I approach betting: strategic, not impulsive.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Peter:** Absolutely. Because if you analyze typical home screen color distribution, purple is underrepresented. Most apps cluster in blue/red/green zones. Purple creates distinctiveness through strategic differentiation. During live matches when I need quick access, that differentiation translates to faster recognition time without requiring aggressive, anxiety-inducing colors.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Peter:** The associations I get are premium (strong), sophisticated (strong), quality (moderate-high), and strategic depth (moderate). Purple doesn't read as cheap or discount-oriented, which is important for a platform handling financial transactions. Trust-wise, it's not banking-level blue, but it doesn't have red's manipulation signals or yellow's caution associations. For sports betting specifically, purple communicates that the platform is for serious, quality-conscious users, not just casual impulse bettors.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Peter:** **4.5/5**. From a strategic positioning perspective, purple is excellent. It differentiates in a crowded market, signals quality and sophistication, avoids manipulation perceptions, and creates strong visual recognition. The only minor concern is that purple doesn't have the established trust signals of traditional blue, but for sports betting—which is more entertainment than pure finance—that's an acceptable trade-off for better differentiation and premium positioning.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Peter:** I think purple positions you well for the strategic bettor segment, which tends to have higher lifetime value than impulse bettors. Red and yellow might get more immediate attention, but they also signal tactics over substance. Purple says "we're confident in our product quality and don't need to use psychological pressure." That resonates with data-driven users like me who want sophisticated tools, not just flashy interfaces.
