## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Viktor:** The reason purple works here is because technically, from a game design perspective, purple has strong associations with premium gaming experiences. Think about high-quality games and entertainment platforms—Twitch uses purple, Roku uses purple, premium casino aesthetics often use purple with gold. The color signals quality and sophistication, which is critical when users are making financial decisions within an entertainment context.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Viktor:** Purple creates the right psychological framing for casino games. Casino gaming should feel luxurious, mysterious, and rewarding—not stressful or urgent. Red creates tension and anxiety, which works against the casino game experience of relaxation and exploration. Yellow can feel cautionary. But purple hits the sweet spot: it's engaging without being aggressive, it's premium without being stuffy, and it has that mysterious, "what might I discover" quality that's perfect for slot exploration and game variety. From a game design standpoint, that's excellent color psychology application.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Viktor:** Absolutely. From a UI/UX perspective, purple provides high contrast and minimal competition in the typical app icon color space. Most gaming apps use bright, aggressive colors (red, yellow, orange) or safe corporate colors (blue). Purple differentiates while maintaining premium perception. Recognition speed would be high because the color is distinctive without being jarring.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Viktor:** The associations are: premium (very high), luxury (high), quality (high), creativity (high), mystery/discovery (moderate), sophistication (high). Purple doesn't trigger warning associations like red or yellow. It doesn't read as cheap—historically, purple dye was expensive, and that luxury association persists in color psychology. Energy-wise, it's moderate—enough to maintain engagement but not so high that it creates fatigue. For casino games specifically, those associations are ideal. Trust is moderate, which is fine for entertainment-finance hybrid.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Viktor:** **4.5/5**. From both a game design and UX perspective, purple is an excellent strategic choice. It aligns with premium gaming aesthetics, creates appropriate psychological framing, differentiates effectively, and avoids the manipulation signals that red and yellow carry. The half-point deduction is just to account for execution risk—purple needs to be the right shade and paired with quality typography. But conceptually? This is really strong work.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Viktor:** In game development, we're constantly thinking about how color influences player psychology and behavior. Purple is one of the smartest choices you could make for casino gaming. It signals that you care about experience quality, not just immediate engagement. That's the difference between a platform that builds loyalty and one that burns through users. If you execute this well—right shade of purple, clean UI, quality game selection—purple will reinforce all the right associations. Just make sure your in-app experience matches the premium promise the icon makes.
