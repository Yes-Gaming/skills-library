## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Nikolaj:** Compared to the typical betting app color schemes—red (William Hill, Ladbrokes), blue (Bet365), black/yellow (Bwin)—purple represents strategic differentiation. The metrics show that premium brands across industries use purple to signal quality and sophistication: Crown Royal, Cadbury, Asprey. For a betting platform, that positioning suggests confidence in product quality rather than reliance on urgency tactics.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Nikolaj:** From a strategic betting perspective, purple creates appropriate psychological framing. The color psychology research indicates purple balances energy (needed for engagement) with calm (needed for rational decision-making). Compared to red, which triggers emotional arousal and impulsive behavior (counterproductive for systematic betting), purple maintains engagement without compromising analytical thinking. That's strategically aligned with how serious bettors like me operate.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Nikolaj:** The metrics show purple usage in mobile apps is approximately 3-5% of total app icons, compared to blue (32%), red (18%), green (15%). That scarcity creates high recognition efficiency. During live matches when I need quick access for in-play betting, purple would provide top-quartile recognition speed through strategic differentiation rather than sensory aggression.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Nikolaj:** Looking at color association data: Purple scores premium (72%), luxury (74%), quality (68%), sophistication (71%), creativity (65%). Low scores on cheap (12%), discount (9%), warning (7%). Trust metrics are moderate (48-52%), which is acceptable for entertainment-finance hybrid products. Compared to yellow (trust: 23%) and red (trust: 16%), purple's trust profile is significantly superior. Energy levels are moderate (52%), which supports sustained engagement without triggering decision-making impairment.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Nikolaj:** **4/5**. The analytical case for purple is compelling. Differentiation metrics are excellent, premium perception is high, trust deficit is minimal, psychological profile supports rational decision-making, and competitive positioning is strategically sound. The one-point deduction accounts for purple's moderate rather than high trust score—it's optimal for entertainment-finance hybrid but not pure financial services. However, compared to alternatives (yellow: 3.4/5, red: 2.6/5), purple represents statistically superior positioning.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Nikolaj:** From a market positioning perspective, purple solves the fundamental challenge in gambling platforms: you need to signal entertainment value (to attract users) while maintaining credibility (to build trust for financial transactions). Purple occupies the optimal position in this two-dimensional space. The key success factors will be: (1) precise shade selection—test multiple purple variations for optimal premium perception; (2) consistent brand system that reinforces quality positioning; (3) operational excellence to deliver on the quality promise that purple establishes. If executed well, purple should outperform red and yellow across all critical metrics: user acquisition, conversion, retention, and lifetime value.
