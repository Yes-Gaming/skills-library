## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Hanne:** The reason purple works from a trust perspective is because when you consider the alternatives—red signals danger and urgency, yellow suggests caution, bright colors often indicate manipulation—purple represents a more sophisticated, professional approach. It's not trying to trigger impulsive behavior, which is important when evaluating whether a gambling platform is responsible.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Hanne:** Purple feels premium and professional. When I evaluate gambling platforms, I look for signals that the company prioritizes user experience and long-term relationships over short-term engagement tactics. Purple suggests quality and sophistication rather than desperation for attention. That's a good sign. Red would make me immediately suspicious—"why are they using danger colors?" Purple doesn't trigger those concerns. It feels like a platform that's confident in its offering and doesn't need psychological manipulation.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Hanne:** Yes, but not in an anxiety-inducing way. I want to find my apps quickly, but I don't want colors that create stress or urgency. Purple achieves recognition through differentiation rather than psychological arousal. That's the right approach for a service I use regularly and responsibly.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Hanne:** The associations I get are: premium (very strong), professional (strong), quality (strong), sophisticated (strong), trustworthy (moderate-to-good). Purple doesn't have the warning associations of red or the caution associations of yellow. It doesn't look cheap or discount-oriented, which matters when you're trusting a platform with financial transactions. Trust-wise, purple isn't banking-blue, but for entertainment with financial components, it strikes an appropriate balance. It's credible without being stuffy.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Hanne:** **4.5/5**. From a trust evaluation perspective, purple is an excellent choice. It signals quality, professionalism, and sophistication without triggering manipulation concerns. The reason I'm not giving it a full 5 is that color alone doesn't create trust—operational transparency, licensing visibility, and responsible gambling tools do. But purple sets the right tone. If you back it up with genuine trustworthy practices, purple is a strong strategic choice.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Hanne:** I've seen too many gambling platforms use aggressive colors (red, yellow, bright orange) to manipulate users. Purple suggests you're taking a different approach—building trust through quality rather than exploiting urgency. That's refreshing. My advice: make sure your operational practices match the sophisticated, trustworthy tone that purple establishes. If purple is just a prettier wrapper around predatory practices, it won't work. But if you genuinely prioritize user well-being and transparency, purple reinforces those values beautifully.
