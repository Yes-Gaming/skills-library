## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Kasper:** Interesting. Most betting apps use either aggressive reds or "trust me" blues. Purple is less common, which means it's either a smart strategic move or someone didn't get the memo about industry conventions. Given how predatory most platforms are, I'm cautiously curious about purple. It's not the typical manipulation playbook.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Kasper:** Purple feels less predatory than red or yellow. I cover the gambling industry, so I know exactly what red is designed to do—trigger urgency, impulse, emotional betting. Purple doesn't have those same manipulation associations. It feels more like a premium entertainment brand (HBO, Roku) than a pressure-tactics betting site. That's... actually refreshing. But I'm still skeptical of gambling platforms in general, so the color alone doesn't win me over.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Kasper:** Yes, but not in the anxiety-inducing way that red does. Purple stands out through differentiation, not through psychological pressure. That's a better approach if you're trying to build long-term trust rather than just extracting short-term engagement.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Kasper:** Premium, definitely. Sophisticated. Creative. Purple doesn't scream "desperate for your attention," which most betting apps do. It also doesn't have the warning/danger associations that red has—and yes, I'm aware that responsible gambling warnings use red, so choosing red as your brand color is incredibly tone-deaf. Purple avoids that trap. Trust-wise, it's neutral to slightly positive. Not as trustworthy as traditional banking blue, but way better than manipulative red.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Kasper:** **3.5/5**. I'm pleasantly surprised. Purple shows that someone thought about brand perception beyond immediate attention-grabbing. It's a more mature, less predatory choice. However, I'm inherently skeptical of gambling platforms regardless of color. Purple gets you points for not using obvious manipulation tactics, but the industry as a whole has trust issues that color alone can't solve. If you back purple with genuine responsible gambling practices and transparency, then it could work well.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Kasper:** Most betting apps use the same playbook: aggressive colors, urgent messaging, psychological pressure. Purple suggests you might be trying to break that pattern, which is good. But I've seen too many platforms that look premium on the surface while using dark patterns underneath. Purple is a good start—it sets a better tone than red or yellow. Just make sure your operational practices match the sophistication your color choice promises.
