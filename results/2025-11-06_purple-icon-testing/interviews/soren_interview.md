## Interview Questions & Responses

### 1. First reaction to PURPLE app icon on home screen?

**Søren:** Compared to typical gambling platform color schemes—red (high-risk associations), yellow (caution associations), blue (standard trust positioning)—purple represents strategic differentiation with premium positioning. The data indicates that purple creates trust through quality signals rather than explicit trust claims. That's sophisticated brand strategy.

### 2. How does PURPLE make you feel in gaming/entertainment context?

**Søren:** The analytical case for purple is compelling. Color psychology research shows purple scores high on premium perception (72%), luxury (74%), and sophistication (68%). For gambling platforms—which must balance entertainment appeal with financial credibility—purple occupies an optimal position. Red triggers emotional decision-making (bad for calculated risk assessment). Yellow suggests caution or warning. Purple maintains engagement while supporting rational analysis. That aligns with how high-value users like me approach gambling: as calculated entertainment, not emotional impulsivity.

### 3. Would PURPLE help you find and recognize the app quickly?

**Søren:** Analysis shows purple usage in mobile apps is 3-5%, creating high differentiation. Recognition speed correlates with visual uniqueness. Purple would achieve top-quartile recognition efficiency without requiring psychological arousal tactics that compromise decision quality.

### 4. Does PURPLE give specific associations (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, trust, etc.)?

**Søren:** Analyzing association data: premium (72%), luxury (74%), quality (68%), sophistication (71%), creativity (65%). Low scores: cheap (12%), warning (7%), discount (9%). Trust metrics are moderate (48-52%)—not banking-level (blue: 71%) but significantly superior to red (16%) and yellow (23%). For entertainment-finance hybrid category, that trust profile is acceptable. The key is that purple builds trust through quality perception rather than explicit trust claims. That's more sustainable positioning.

### 5. Rating 1-5 for PURPLE app icon?

**Søren:** **4.5/5**. The strategic case for purple is excellent. Differentiation is high, premium positioning is strong, manipulation concerns are minimal, psychological profile supports rational decision-making, and trust deficit relative to blue is offset by superior entertainment positioning. Compared to tested alternatives—yellow (3.4/5, trust problems), red (2.6/5, catastrophic trust failure)—purple represents statistically optimal positioning. The half-point deduction accounts for purple's moderate rather than high baseline trust, but that's a reasonable trade-off for entertainment-finance hybrid positioning.

### 6. Any other thoughts about PURPLE as brand color?

**Søren:** From a financial advisory perspective, I evaluate investments based on risk-reward optimization. Purple represents optimal color strategy for gambling platforms: it maximizes differentiation and premium perception while minimizing trust deficits and manipulation concerns. The key success factors are: (1) precise shade selection—premium purple, not bright or neon; (2) consistent brand system that delivers on quality promise; (3) operational transparency that converts color-based trust into experience-based trust. If executed properly, purple should outperform all alternatives across critical metrics: user acquisition cost, conversion rate, lifetime value, and retention. This is smart strategic positioning.
