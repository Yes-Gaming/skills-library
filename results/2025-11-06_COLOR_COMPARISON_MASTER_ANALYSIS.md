## TRUST VS EXCITEMENT MATRIX

```
HIGH TRUST
    |
    |   BLACK (4.6)  BLUE (4.3)
    |
    |   PURPLE (4.3)
    |        GREEN (4.1)
    |
    |              GOLDEN (3.4)
    |
    |                    ORANGE (2.8)
    |                         YELLOW (2.5)
    |
    |                              PINK (2.0)
    |                                  RED (1.3)
LOW TRUST ------------------------------------ HIGH EXCITEMENT
```

**Insight:** PURPLE is the only color in the "sweet spot" - high trust AND reasonable excitement. BLACK and BLUE sacrifice too much excitement. YELLOW, RED, PINK sacrifice too much trust.
