## Interview Questions & Responses

**Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a yellow app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

It stands out. Yellow pops. Could be good for finding it quick, I guess.

**Q2: How does yellow make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

Fun. Energetic. Not boring, at least. It's got that "let's go" vibe, you know? I like it better than gray or blue.

---

**Q3: Would yellow help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

Yeah, definitely. Yellow's not common on my home screen. I'd spot it right away. That's actually useful when I just want to jump in on a Friday night.

**Q4: Does yellow give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

Energy and fun. Not cheap-looking. Caution? No, not really. It just feels... happy? Ready? Like something good's about to happen.

**Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a yellow app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

4. I like it. It's eye-catching and fits the gaming vibe. Not overthinking it.

**Q6: Any other thoughts about yellow as our brand color for the app icon?**

No, I think it's solid. Makes the app feel approachable. Easy to find. That's all I care about—quick, simple, done. Yellow works.
