## Interview Questions & Responses

### Question 1: First Reaction to Yellow App Icon

**Q: What's your first reaction when you see a yellow app icon on your iPhone home screen?**

**A:** If we compare this to the typical app icon landscape on my home screen, yellow is quite distinctive. Looking at my current apps - I've got the usual blue tones from social media, grays from productivity tools, and some greens from banking apps - yellow immediately stands out. My first reaction is that it's bold, definitely attention-grabbing. The data on color visibility is interesting here: yellow ranks quite high for distinguishability in icon arrays, which from a UX perspective is actually quite smart. It catches the eye without being aggressive like red would be.

### Question 2: Yellow in Gaming/Entertainment Context

**Q: How does yellow make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?**

**A:** Compared to what I'd expect from a gaming platform, yellow evokes something interesting. It doesn't immediately scream "gambling" or "financial risk" - which is actually a positive thing for me personally. To me, yellow in entertainment apps typically communicates approachability and energy rather than sophistication or caution. If I look at gaming apps I've used before, yellow tends to appear in casual, fun-oriented platforms rather than serious financial platforms. For Yes Games, this positioning could work well - it suggests this is entertainment-focused rather than solely wealth-focused. That said, the tone of yellow matters significantly. A bright, saturated yellow feels more playful, while a darker gold tone could feel more premium. Based on the research I've read about color psychology, yellow is associated with optimism and engagement, which aligns well with entertainment.

### Question 3: Recognition and Quick Navigation

**Q: Would yellow help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?**

**A:** Absolutely, yes. From a practical standpoint, when I'm quickly scanning my home screen - and the data shows the average user does this in about 2-3 seconds - yellow is one of the fastest colors to process. Compared to my banking apps which are predominantly blue and gray, or social media apps that blend together visually, yellow creates immediate contrast. If we think about the cognitive load perspective, having a distinctly yellow icon means I don't have to read the label; I can identify it by color alone. That's efficient. However, I should note that this depends on the shade. A muted or desaturated yellow might lose some of this advantage. The contrast ratio would be important here - if the "YES" logotype uses a color that doesn't contrast sufficiently against the yellow background, that could actually hurt recognition rather than help it.

### Question 4: Associations and Emotional Response

**Q: Does yellow give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?**

**A:** This is where the analytical breakdown gets interesting. Yellow triggers several associations depending on context and saturation:

**Positive associations:** Energy, optimism, accessibility, fun, friendliness. If we compare it to how premium financial apps use color - gold accents, deep blues, sophisticated palettes - yellow feels more approachable and less intimidating.

**Potential concerns:** There's a risk of it feeling slightly casual or less premium than competitors might. If I'm comparing Yes Games to other iGaming platforms in my mind, they typically use deeper, more sophisticated color schemes - dark blues, blacks, metallics. Yellow could read as more playful than serious.

**The "caution" factor:** I don't inherently think "warning" when I see yellow in a game app context, but I do think about visibility and attention. That's not negative - it's actually useful.

**Neither cheap nor premium on its own:** The premium feeling comes more from execution and design quality than the color choice itself. Looking at luxury apps, some use bold colors effectively, so yellow's perception as premium versus casual depends heavily on how it's paired with typography, imagery, and overall design language.

### Question 5: Rating Scale (1-5)

**Q: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a yellow app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)**

**A:** I'd rate this a **4 out of 5**.

**Reasoning:** The practical benefits are strong - high visibility, quick recognition, distinctive in a crowded app space. For someone analytical like me, those functional advantages matter significantly. The emotional response is also positive - yellow feels welcoming rather than off-putting.

The reason it's not a 5 is that I have some reservations about how it positions the brand relative to competitors. If I'm comparing Yes Games to other platforms, would yellow make it feel less serious or trustworthy than apps using more traditional gaming palette choices? That's a perception question that might vary by user segment. For me specifically, I respond well to transparency and clarity, so if the yellow communicates "we're transparent and approachable," that's perfect. But if it reads as "we're casual and less serious," that concerns me slightly.

### Question 6: Additional Thoughts on Yellow as Brand Color

**Q: Any other thoughts about yellow as our brand color for the app icon?**

**A:** A few data points worth considering:

**1. Context matters:** The yellow needs to work across different device backgrounds and home screen themes. If I compare it to my current setup with a light wallpaper versus a dark one, that changes how it's perceived. Have you tested this across both light and dark home screen scenarios?

**2. Brand consistency:** If we're committing to yellow as the primary icon color, I'd want to understand how this extends to other touchpoints. The app's interior design, notifications, interactive elements - does yellow play a consistent role? Consistency builds recognition and trust, which matters for financial products.

**3. Competitive positioning:** From a strategic perspective, using a bold, unconventional color like yellow could be a differentiation advantage if competitors all use traditional colors. But it could also read as trying too hard to stand out. The question becomes: does the color choice align with the actual brand positioning?

**4. Accessibility consideration:** Yellow text on white can have contrast issues, so while the icon background being yellow is fine, I'd want assurance that any secondary elements or text on the icon itself meet WCAG standards.

**5. Cultural consideration:** In Danish context specifically, yellow has positive associations - it's bright and energetic without the same caution connotations it might carry in other cultures. That plays in its favor here.

Overall, if we compare the options, yellow is a strong choice for visibility and memorability. The main risk is perception positioning rather than the color itself. I'd be curious to see how it performs in user testing with other demographic segments, particularly older demographics who might have different color associations with gaming and finance.

## Interview Summary

**Overall Sentiment:** Positive with analytical caveats

**Key Takeaways:**
- Functional benefits of yellow are strong (visibility, recognition, distinctiveness)
- Emotional response is favorable (energetic, approachable, fun)
- Primary concern is competitive positioning and premium perception
- Technical execution matters more than color choice alone
- Recommend testing across different device contexts and user demographics
