## Question 1: What's your first reaction when you see a yellow app icon on your iPhone home screen?

Well, I think my first reaction would actually be quite positive, but let me walk through why. You see, when you're looking at an iPhone home screen, it's typically dominated by quite a lot of different colors and visual elements. Yellow is interesting because it immediately stands out—not in an aggressive way, but in a way that naturally draws your eye.

The reason I'd find this appealing is that yellow is one of the warmer colors in the spectrum. If I'm honest, my first thought would be something like: "This is a friendly, approachable app." It wouldn't feel corporate or cold to me. But I also need to be careful here—context matters a lot. A bright, saturated yellow on a gaming platform could read as either playful or slightly amateurish depending on the execution. So my initial reaction would be curiosity about the specific shade and how the YES logotype is rendered on top of it.

## Question 2: How does yellow make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?

That's a really interesting question because, as a designer, I think about this a lot. Yellow in gaming and entertainment contexts has a few associations that come to mind immediately. First, there's the energy aspect—yellow typically evokes excitement, playfulness, and optimism. For an entertainment app, that's actually quite valuable because you want users to feel like the experience inside is going to be engaging and fun.

However, I need to think through this carefully because iGaming has its own nuances. The reason I'd be cautious is that yellow can sometimes feel cheap or unrefined if it's not handled well. But if it's done with intention—like, if you're using a sophisticated, well-balanced yellow that feels intentional rather than garish—then it actually signals something more premium. It's like the difference between a bright, neon yellow versus a more refined, golden-toned yellow.

In terms of my personal emotional response: yellow makes me feel energized and positive. For a gaming app where I'm spending time on Sunday afternoons, that's not a bad thing. It sets a tone of "this is about entertainment and fun," not "this is serious business." I appreciate that clarity.

## Question 3: Would yellow help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?

Absolutely, yes—and let me explain why that's important from a UX perspective. When you're scrolling through your home screen or looking in your app drawer, you're essentially pattern-matching. Your brain is looking for distinctive visual elements, and color is one of the strongest signals we have for quick recognition.

Yellow is actually quite distinctive on most iPhone home screens. The reason is simple: most major apps use blues, greens, reds, blacks, and whites. YouTube uses red and white, Instagram uses pink and purple, Twitter uses blue. Yellow is less common, which actually works in your favor. This means that Yes Games would have what we call "visual real estate"—it would create its own space in the user's mental map of their phone.

From a practical standpoint, I think I'd find it very easy to locate. If I'm swiping through my home screen on a Sunday afternoon wanting to play some games, I'd quickly think, "That's the yellow one," and tap it without much cognitive effort. That's actually a win in terms of UX design because you've reduced friction in the user journey.

## Question 4: Does yellow give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?

Well, I think the associations with yellow are quite rich, and they layer on top of each other in interesting ways. Let me break this down:

**Energy and Fun:** Yellow definitely evokes energy. It's vibrant, it's warm, and it signals something lively is happening. For a gaming platform, that's exactly the right association to have.

**Optimism:** There's something inherently optimistic about yellow. It's a hopeful color, which is interesting in the gaming context—games are often about progression, winning, achieving goals. Yellow fits that narrative.

**Caution:** Now, the thing I need to be honest about is that yellow does have historical associations with caution and warning. Think of traffic signs and hazard symbols. So if the yellow feels too intense or aggressive, there's a risk that some users might subconsciously register a slight warning signal. But I think this is mitigated by context and execution.

**Premium vs. Cheap:** Here's where the design execution really matters. If the yellow is paired with clean typography, good spacing, and refined design elements, it reads as modern and premium. If it's garish or poorly executed, it could feel cheap. So it's not the color itself, it's how you're using it.

**Personal Association:** For me personally, yellow makes me feel positive and approachable. I don't associate it with anything negative or cheap, especially if it's clearly a deliberate brand choice. In fact, some premium brands use yellow effectively—think of certain luxury goods that use yellow as an accent color.

## Question 5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a yellow app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)

I'd give it a **4 out of 5**, and let me explain my reasoning because I think the nuance here is important.

The reason I'm not giving it a 5 is not because yellow is wrong—it's because I'd need to see the actual execution. As a designer, I know that a color in isolation means very little. What matters is how that color is integrated with typography, how much whitespace or padding there is, what the contrast is like, and how the YES logotype sits on the yellow background. A poorly executed yellow icon could bring that score down to a 2 or 3. A beautifully executed one could push it to a 5.

But conceptually, as an idea? I'm genuinely enthusiastic about it. The reason is that it's distinctive, it's positive, it's playful without being unprofessional, and it solves a real UX problem by being easy to locate on a home screen. Those are solid fundamentals.

My one caveat is that I'd want to see this tested in context. I'd want to see mockups of the icon on actual iPhone home screens with other apps around it. I'd want to evaluate the contrast and legibility. But based on the concept alone, yellow feels like a smart choice for a gaming entertainment app, especially in a market where you need to stand out.

## Question 6: Any other thoughts about yellow as your brand color for the app icon?

Yes, actually, I have a few additional thoughts that I think are worth mentioning.

First, from a branding perspective, yellow is quite bold. It's saying something about the personality of Yes Games. It's saying, "We're approachable, we're fun, we're not trying to be intimidating." That's a strong positioning statement for an iGaming platform, and I think it could actually differentiate you in a market that might otherwise feel corporate or heavy.

Second, I'd think about consistency. If you're using yellow on the app icon, you'll want to ensure that yellow appears in your UI design, your marketing, your brand system overall. The reason is that colors need to feel intentional and consistent—if yellow only appears on the icon and nowhere else, it might feel disconnected from the overall brand experience.

Third, I'd consider the psychology of color in gaming contexts more broadly. Games are about engagement and time spent. Yellow, as a warm color, can actually make people feel more engaged and optimistic about spending time in the app. That's valuable.

Finally, one practical thought: yellow is quite visible in low-light conditions, which is interesting because a lot of gaming happens in the evening or at night. If someone has their phone brightness adjusted or they're using it in dim lighting, the yellow icon would still be visible and distinctive, whereas some other colors might fade or blend in.

Overall, I think yellow is a genuinely good choice. My main recommendation would be to ensure the execution is refined and intentional—no shortcuts, make sure the contrast works, and make sure it feels like a deliberate part of your overall brand identity rather than something isolated to the icon.
