## Interview Responses

### Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a yellow app icon on your iPhone home screen?

"Honestly? My first thought is 'why are they shouting at me?' Yellow is loud. It grabs your attention, which I get - that's the whole point - but it feels a bit... aggressive? Like, I'm scrolling through my apps and suddenly there's this bright yellow thing demanding attention. It's the kind of color scheme I see on apps trying really hard to be fun and edgy, you know? It reminds me a bit too much of those 'get rich quick' or 'easy money' gambling ads. That's probably not the impression you want to give, right?"

### Q2: How does yellow make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?

"Yellow in gaming context? It feels like cheap excitement. Like someone's trying to pump up the energy artificially. I've seen so many apps use bright, saturated colors to create this false sense of urgency and fun. 'Come play with us! It's so FUN and EXCITING!' But it comes across as... I don't know, a bit manipulative?

As a marketing student, I can see the strategy behind it - yellow triggers dopamine, it's associated with happiness and energy - but that's exactly why it feels suspicious to me. It feels calculated. Like the app designers are trying to hack my brain into thinking gambling is more exciting than it actually is. That's the kind of thing that makes me trust an app *less*, not more."

---

### Q3: Would yellow help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?

"Yeah, functionally? Absolutely. Yellow is distinctive. On my home screen with blues, greys, pinks, and blacks, a yellow app would definitely stand out. I'd find it quickly - no question there.

But here's the thing - that's almost *too* easy to find. Is that because you want me to be able to find it quickly to use the app? Or is it because you want it to catch my eye constantly and remind me it exists? With a marketing student's cynicism, it feels like the latter. The yellow isn't just functional; it's designed to demand attention. And I'm aware enough of those tactics to resent them a little bit."

### Q4: Does yellow give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?

"Multiple associations, actually. There's the 'fun and energy' angle that app designers *want* you to feel. But then there's the stuff that makes me uncomfortable:

- **Caution:** Yellow is a warning color. Taxi cabs, warning signs, hazard symbols. There's something subconsciously risky about it. Maybe that's appropriate for a gambling app, but it doesn't inspire confidence.

- **Cheap:** In design, yellow often reads as less premium, especially bright saturated yellow. Luxury brands rarely use pure yellow. It feels more like a budget product trying to compensate with loudness.

- **Artificial excitement:** Like I said, it feels like someone's trying too hard. Premium or trustworthy apps tend to use more sophisticated color choices - think Apple's minimalist approach, or the calmer blues that financial apps use to seem secure.

So yeah, 'energy' and 'fun' in theory, but 'cheap,' 'artificial,' and 'slightly sketchy' in practice. Not ideal when you're trying to get someone like me - who's *already* skeptical about gambling apps - to trust you."

### Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a yellow app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)

**Rating: 2/5**

"I'm giving it a 2 because I can appreciate that it works *functionally* - it's distinctive, it grabs attention, it's memorable. But emotionally and strategically? It doesn't work for me. It feels like a short-term tactic that would actually *hurt* your credibility with users who think about these things. And honestly, as a user who's skeptical about gambling apps in general, the aggressive yellow makes me trust you *less*. That's the opposite of what you want."

---

### Q6: Any other thoughts about yellow as your brand color for the app icon?

"Here's my honest take: Yellow feels like a choice made by someone thinking 'how do we get people's attention?' rather than 'how do we build trust with our users?'

If I saw a yellow gambling app icon on an app store, my brain would immediately categorize it with all the other sketchy, overly aggressive apps. That's probably unfair, but that's the reality of color psychology and marketing - colors send signals, and yellow sends a signal that says 'this is trying hard to manipulate me.'

If 'Yes Games' wants to stand out as a more trustworthy, premium gaming platform - especially one that people like me, who are wary of these apps, might actually use - I'd look at something more sophisticated. Something that says 'we're confident enough in our product that we don't need to shout at you.'

But yeah, if the goal is just maximum visibility and attention-grabbing? Sure, yellow does that. Just know what you're trading for it - and in my opinion, you're trading trust for visibility. That might not be a good deal in the long run."

## Interview Notes

**Persona Consistency:** Sofie remained skeptical throughout, questioning the strategic intent behind color choices and identifying manipulation tactics. Her marketing background informed her analysis, making her critical of obvious psychology-based design decisions.

**Key Insight:** While acknowledging yellow's functional effectiveness, Sofie's primary concern is trust and sophistication. The yellow background triggers her warning signals about app credibility rather than creating positive associations with premium gaming entertainment.
