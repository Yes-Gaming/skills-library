## Interview Responses

### Q1: What's your first reaction when you see a yellow app icon on your iPhone home screen?

**Mikkel's Response:**

Oh man, that's awesome! Yellow just POPS, you know? Like, it immediately catches your eye! When I'm scrolling through my phone looking for an app, something yellow is going to stand out right away – it's not going to blend in with all the boring stuff. I love that! It's like, the yellow is basically screaming "Hey, I'm here! Pick me!" and I'm totally here for that energy. Super vibrant!

### Q2: How does yellow make you feel in the context of a gaming/entertainment app?

**Mikkel's Response:**

YES! This is perfect! Yellow makes me think of excitement, energy, fun – like all the good vibes, you know? When I'm out at the club working, the energy is high, the lights are bright, and I'm looking for that same feeling when I'm gaming late at night. Yellow brings that same buzz! It's got that party vibe, that "something fun is about to happen" feeling. It doesn't feel serious or boring – it feels alive! That's exactly what I want from a gaming app. It's like yellow is saying "Let's have a blast!" and I'm pumped about that!

### Q3: Would yellow help you find and recognize the app quickly among your other apps?

**Mikkel's Response:**

Oh, 100%! Definitely! Yellow is not something you see every day on app icons, right? Most apps are blue, purple, white, whatever – pretty standard stuff. But yellow? That's distinctive! So yeah, I'd find it super fast. I could be halfway through scrolling and just spot that yellow and go "There it is!" without even thinking about it. It's like having a beacon on your home screen! Love that for usability. Quick recognition is key when you're in the mood for a game and don't want to waste time searching. Yellow nails it!

### Q4: Does yellow give you any specific associations or feelings (energy, fun, caution, cheap, premium, etc.)?

**Mikkel's Response:**

Great question! So honestly, yellow for me is all about energy and fun – that's the dominant feeling. It's playful, it's exciting, it's got that "something good is happening" vibe. Premium? Absolutely – I don't think yellow feels cheap at all! It actually feels bold and confident, like a brand that's not afraid to stand out. It's got luxury vibes, like it's saying "We're confident enough to be different!"

The only thing – and I'm being real here – caution never really crosses my mind. Yellow doesn't make me think "Danger!" or anything negative. It's pure positive energy! It's like the sun, you know? Warmth, brightness, happiness. That's what I feel when I see yellow. It's got that premium swagger to it, like "Yeah, we know we're cool!"

### Q5: On a scale of 1-5, how much do you like the idea of a yellow app icon? (1=hate it, 5=love it)

**Mikkel's Response:**

Oh man, easy! **5 out of 5!** No question about it! This is awesome! Yellow is such a smart choice for a gaming app, especially for someone like me who's all about that thrill and energy. It's distinctive, it's fun, it's exciting – everything a gaming app should be! I'd absolutely download an app with a yellow icon. It would make me want to play more, honestly. The color alone makes it feel like more of an experience, you know? I'm obsessed with this idea! Solid 5!

### Q6: Any other thoughts about yellow as our brand color for the app icon?

**Mikkel's Response:**

Man, I'm really digging this direction! One thing I'd say is make sure the yellow is BRIGHT – like, don't go with some muted, dull yellow. That would kill it. Go bold, go vibrant! The brighter and more intense the yellow, the better it matches the energy of gaming. It's gotta pop!

Also, I think yellow works perfectly for the vibe you're going for with a gaming platform. It's not trying to be all serious and corporate – it's saying "We're fun, we're exciting, we're here to have a good time!" That resonates with me 100%. I'd be recommending this app to my friends just based on the icon alone! Seriously though, this yellow idea is gold. Go for it!
