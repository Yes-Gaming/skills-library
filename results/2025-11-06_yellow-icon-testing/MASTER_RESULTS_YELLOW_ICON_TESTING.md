   - Accept potential loss of 40+ conservative bettors
   - Focus on volume vs lifetime value strategy

**Risk Level:** HIGH - May alienate highest-value demographic

## Final Recommendations

### Based on Data Analysis:

1. **If targeting 18-35 casual gamers:** Yellow works (Average rating 3.9/5 in that segment)

- Execute at premium quality level
- Include prominent trust signals immediately
- Test with actual Danish users before launch
