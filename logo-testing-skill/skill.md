# Logo Testing Skill

## Overview

This skill provides a structured methodology for testing logos, brand marks, icons, and visual identity assets with synthetic user personas. It leverages multimodal AI capabilities to analyze visual design elements and gather both quantitative preference data and rich qualitative insights about brand perception.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this testing framework when:
- Evaluating multiple logo design concepts
- Testing logo redesigns or rebrands
- Comparing logo variations (color, layout, typography)
- Assessing brand mark recognition and memorability
- Testing logo effectiveness across different contexts (app icon, website header, merchandise)
- Evaluating visual identity consistency
- Understanding brand perception through visual elements
- Testing logo accessibility and clarity at different sizes

## Logo Testing is Different

Unlike text-based testing (taglines, CTAs), logo testing involves:
- **Visual analysis** - Requires viewing actual image files
- **Emotional response** - Immediate gut reactions to design
- **Brand association** - What the design communicates about the brand
- **Context dependency** - How logo works at different sizes and placements
- **Cultural sensitivity** - Visual symbols have cultural meanings
- **Memorability** - Can users recall and recognize it?
- **Differentiation** - Does it stand out in competitive landscape?

## Testing Methodology

### Standard Test Structure

**Default Configuration:**
- **Rounds per persona:** 10 (adjustable based on needs)
- **Order randomization:** Yes (prevents order bias)
- **Context variation:** Highly recommended (logos appear in many contexts)
- **Asset format:** PNG, JPG, SVG (provided by user)
- **Display modes:** Full size, mobile icon size, favicon size

### Round Format

Each round follows this structure:

1. **Visual Presentation** (CRITICAL - actual image viewing)
   - Display logo image(s) to persona
   - Show in relevant context (app icon, website header, etc.)
   - Can show multiple sizes simultaneously
   - Present in randomized order

2. **Context Setup**
   - Where the logo appears (app store icon, website header, business card)
   - Viewing device (mobile, desktop, print)
   - Surrounding elements (competitor logos, brand colors)
   - User's current state (first impression, comparison shopping)

3. **Response Collection**
   - Mix of immediate reactions and considered responses
   - Visual element identification
   - Emotional and brand perception
   - Practical usability assessment

4. **Record Keeping**
   - Log which logo was presented first
   - Capture verbatim visual descriptions
   - Note specific design elements mentioned
   - Track emotional responses

## Question Templates

```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ **Always provide actual image files** - logos must be viewed, not described
- ✅ **Test at multiple sizes** - logo should work at 16px and 1000px
- ✅ **Test in context** - show how logo appears in real usage
- ✅ **Capture immediate reactions** - first 3-5 seconds matter most
- ✅ **Ask about specific elements** - colors, shapes, symbols
- ✅ **Test across personas** - age groups see design very differently
- ✅ **Check for negative associations** - what turns people off
- ✅ **Compare to competitors** - differentiation is critical
- ✅ **Test context versatility** - app icon, website, print, etc.
- ✅ **Record emotional responses** - gut reactions predict brand connection

### Don'ts
- ❌ **Don't describe logos in text** - must show actual visual
- ❌ **Don't skip small size testing** - app icons need to work tiny
- ❌ **Don't ignore trust metrics (Q4)** - especially critical for gambling
- ❌ **Don't test too many variations** - max 4-5 logo options
- ❌ **Don't skip negative reaction questions** - need to find red flags
- ❌ **Don't ignore cultural context** - symbols mean different things
- ❌ **Don't assume designer intent = perception** - test what users actually see
- ❌ **Don't test without competitive context** - need to stand out
- ❌ **Don't forget accessibility** - color blindness, contrast, clarity
- ❌ **Don't skip context variation** - one context isn't enough

## Integration with Persona Skills

This skill should be used in conjunction with:
- `casual-entertainer` - Visual preferences of younger, entertainment-focused users
- `casino-explorer` - Emphasis on visual quality and premium feel
- `sports-enthusiast` - Professional, serious brand perception
- `trust-seeker` - Trust signals and credibility in visual design (CRITICAL)
- `cross-entertainment-engager` - Modern, integrated brand feel

**Protocol:**
1. Prepare logo asset files (PNG, various sizes)
2. Load this logo testing skill
3. Load target persona skill(s)
4. Present visual assets to persona
5. Run test rounds with question framework
6. Compile visual and perception data
7. Generate report with design recommendations

## Multimodal AI Capabilities

This skill leverages Claude's vision capabilities:
- **Image analysis** - Can view and analyze actual logo files
- **Visual element identification** - Colors, shapes, typography
- **Design critique** - Professional design assessment
- **Context simulation** - Can imagine logo in different contexts
- **Comparative analysis** - Side-by-side logo comparison
- **Cultural awareness** - Symbol and color meanings across cultures

**How to provide logos:**
- Upload image files directly to conversation
- Provide URLs to logo images
- Share screenshots of logos in context
- Use design tool exports (Figma, Adobe, etc.)

## Notes on Statistical Validity

With 10 rounds per persona:
- **7-3 split** suggests moderate preference
- **8-2 or stronger** suggests strong preference
- **5-5 split** suggests no clear winner (test more rounds or refine designs)
- **Visual consensus** - When people notice same elements, design hierarchy is clear
- **Perception alignment** - When brand perception matches intent, design is successful

**Remember:**
- Logo testing is subjective but patterns emerge
- Younger personas may prefer modern/bold, older prefer traditional/trustworthy
- First impressions matter most (3-5 seconds)
- Trust is most critical metric for gambling platforms
- Validate synthetic results with real user testing

**Always A/B test winning logo in production before full rebrand.**
